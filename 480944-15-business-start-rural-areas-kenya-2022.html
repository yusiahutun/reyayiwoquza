With lower legal fees and statutory obligations, the right entrepreneurial discipline should warrant the business’s success.</p><h2>Best business to start in rural areas in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>The rural areas offer vast undeveloped land that provides space for extensive farming. In addition, the simple cost of setting up companies and lower production costs make rural areas the perfect environment for business. Here are some of the best businesses to start in rural areas in Kenya, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tafuta Kenya</a>:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12a53bedd6456005.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 most profitable crops per acre to grow in Kenya in 2024</span></p></a><h3>1. Greenhouse farming</h3><p class=align-left>Which is the most profitable business in rural areas? Due to ample space and arable in rural areas, greenhouse farming is the main economic activity. Hence green housing farming is among the most profitable businesses in rural areas.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Share your outstanding story with our editors! Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690.</p><p class=align-left>A farmer utilizing 8 meters by 15 meters could make up to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kshs. 195,000</a> by growing 500 plants of tomatoes and harvesting around 7.5 tonnes. Other crops such as capsicum, cucumber, melons, and onions are also grown in greenhouses, and having multiple houses could generate enormous profits.</p><h3>2. Rabbit rearing</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike other forms of agribusiness like livestock farming, rabbit farming is a low-capital investment venture. The rear of the rabbit for sale and personal consumption is a sustainable business alternative that farmers can decide to start. Rabbit meat is rich in protein content and advisable for people to consume due to its lower cholesterol than red meat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs25f7tnbe4o2g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rabbit farming in Kenya - rabbit buyers in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Rabbit skins are also a sought-after commodity in leather factories for their shoe and bag-making attributes. The bones are also used in the production of livestock feed hence ensuring nothing goes to waste. With the average price per kilo topping Ksh. 500, making rabbit rearing a rational decision.</p><h3>3. Brick-making business</h3><p class=align-left>The manufacturing <a href=#>business ideas </a>for rural areas that require moderate capital to initiate are brick making. The bricks ideal for both hot and cold weather are quite suitable to start in rural areas due to the availability of raw materials. Brickmaking requires clay, sand, concrete materials, water, and a pressing machine.</p><p class=align-left>The bricks are then dried by frying them in a kiln to harden them, making them a durable construction material. The brickmaking machine ranges from between <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kshs. 30,000 to 400,000 </a>to purchase. The return on investment ranges between 100,000 annually and is a suitable business that could create jobs in the rural area.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs537dv173pjg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to succeed at dairy farming in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>4. M-Pesa business/ agent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12a53bedd6456005.jpg><p class=align-left>How do rural areas make money in Kenya? The majority of people in rural areas rely on farming to make money. The selling of farm produce earns farmers some form of revenue; hence they require some platform to send money to their loved ones other than banks. Safaricom is currently the leading mobile operator in the country, and its money-sending platform Mpesa is widespread across the country.</p><p class=align-left>Partnering with the service provider to establish a Mpesa shop in the local areas as an agent is also another business opportunity. The business makes it convenient for people to transact without travelling far distances, and you will earn a commission from the transactions. The business is another way of making an extra coin in rural areas.</p><h3>5. Poultry farming</h3><p class=align-left>The majority of Kenyans consume eggs and other poultry products regularly. The limited space in urban areas means that most poultry is imported or brought into town from rural areas. The diet is a high preference for most people due to its high source of protein and simplicity in cooking.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3cp6vuqhepsg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Large scale rabbit farming in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With so much available space in rural areas, poultry farming is among the businesses that do well in rural areas. This is because the demand for eggs and poultry products is enough to satisfy and exceed the suppliers’ production. Therefore, with enough capital, a dedicated team, and proper infrastructure, a farmer could rear up to 1000 chickens on a small plot of land.</p><h3>6. Agro-vet / fertilizer store</h3><p class=align-left>An agro-vet business is among the most profitable small businesses in rural areas. Like a convenience store, farmers will always require fertilizers and a good seed grade at the onset of the rainy season for planting. Having the right knowledge or hiring a professional expert to advise farmers on the proper seed grade to plant and the proper animal feeds to buy will boost sales.</p><p class=align-left>An agro vet business selling suitable seedlings for farmers to plant would seem the right and valid option. Combining the business with<a href=#> veterinary services</a> for the local population’s livestock will make the business worthwhile. An agro-vet store is a money-making venture that will have a passionate and dedicated entrepreneur laughing all the way to the bank.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs6kq671jit49.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Business plan for pig farming in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>7. Milk-dairy vending centre</h3><p class=align-left>Most farmers in rural areas rear livestock for milk or meat consumption. Therefore, opening a milk vending or cooling plant in rural areas is a lucrative business for any entrepreneur. Although the business requires intensive capital to purchase or acquire milk fridges or coolants, the investment is worthwhile in the long run.</p><p class=align-left>The popularity of milk ATMs in urban areas is a business opportunity to tap. Purchasing milk at a discounted fee per litre from farmers and repurposing the milk for resale in towns at a higher fee will return on investment within a few. The business is worth every penny with proper health certification from relevant authorities.</p><h3>8. Local campsites</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs25f7tnbe4o2g.jpg><p class=align-left>The rural areas are blessed with rich heritage and sight-seeing nature sites under which tourists flock. Driving outside the city is a perfect gateway to elevate stress and help individuals bond.</p><p class=align-left>Creating a campsite or an outdoor adventure site like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">camp Ndunda</a> away from the bustling city is a great business venture. The facility could make money by charging fees for people to undertake fun activities such as:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3mjbhik3jeng.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Challenges of rabbit farming in Kenya</span></p></a><ul><li>Zip lining</li><li>tug of war</li><li>hiking or nature trail</li><li>waterfall sighting</li><li>Archery</li><li>Team building</li></ul><h3>9. Hotel, restaurant, and lodging camps</h3><p class=align-left>The hotelier and<a href=#> catering industry</a> is always a lucrative business. Some company executives prefer hosting their meetings in hotels way out of town. The rural area is a prime location for building such facilities to host such events due to their relatively low noise pollution. Companies also prefer taking their staff on team building and bonding exercises.</p><p class=align-left>The restaurant, hotels, and lodging facilities in rural areas are prime locations for their refreshing-cool environment. Most companies seek an atmosphere that will take away the minds of their staff from the monotonous, stressful office environment. The lodging could also provide accommodation for those in transit; hence the hotel-lodging alternative is a decent investment venture.</p><h3>10. Gas station</h3><p class=align-left>Opening a gas station in rural areas may seem like an odd thing to undertake, but fair enough, the sector has immense potential. The business is capital-intensive to start, but the venture has its own set of returns. For example, fuelling vehicles in transit may make some money, but tapping into the Boda Boda sector will return on investment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs25mrc9i9i4cg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rabbit farming in Kenya; Business plan and tips</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many youths in rural areas rely on their Boda Boda as an income-generating activity. The sector is a huge employer for many youths helping them sustain their families. Opening a gas station to tap into the established market of mot motorcycles and kerosene seems a good business venture to invest in.</p><h3>11. Hair salon and barber shop</h3><p class=align-left>The beauty industry has undergone a massive transformation over the years. Among the businesses you can open in the rural area are the <a href=#>cosmetic hair salon</a> and barber shop business. Most young people and the middle class have embraced the <a href=#>western</a> style and culture.</p><p class=align-left>Beauty is at the forefront of most people's perceptions, whereby looking excellent or beautiful is paramount. Even in rural areas, the service industry is on an uphill trajectory, with people searching for cosmetics and hair grooming. However, the market demand for the sector is present and will always be there for the foreseeable future, meaning there is enormous potential for growth within the coming years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsdbs9kas8u7o.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Business Ideas in Kenya - Top Farming Opportunities to Try Out</span></p></a><h3>12. Furniture repair and upholstering</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs537dv173pjg.jpg><p class=align-left>With an abundance of trees for sourcing wood, a furniture upholstering business is a perfect score. The demand for home decor furniture, beds, chairs, and desks is innumerable. With a ready source of raw materials, the necessary capital to start other requirements should be minimal. Therefore it is a worthwhile investment to undertake.</p><p class=align-left>The geolocation of rural settings should be unrestricted for business operations. For example, as an entrepreneur, you could ship materials made from your worksite for resale in urban areas. The furniture sector is rising and is a tenable business to start.</p><h3>13. Fish farming</h3><p class=align-left>Fishing farming is an alternative business venture in rural areas to meet protein supplement needs in the Kenyan market. Freshwater fish farming in rural areas could be carried out in a fish pond.</p><p class=align-left>Farming is intensive in setting up ponds and finding the right information on fish species to the rear with the climatic conditions. Tilapia require <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">warm waters of 25℃ </a>and acquiring professional help to manage the farm control parasites, and diseases is essential.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs23mm2ug3g68.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dairy Farming in Kenya: How to Succeed in This Lucrative Business</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although with the financial hurdles to kick start the project, in the installation of filtration systems, fish farming is a high-earning business. With an appetite for <a href=#>fish consumption</a> in the country, the venture is a good business.</p><h3>14. Cashew-nut processing</h3><p class=align-left>Cashew nut farming is a sustainable cash crop, especially in the arable regions of Kenya, such as Kwale and <a href=# rel=noopener>Kilifi</a>. Therefore, growing the cash crop and later processing it for resale is a business opportunity.</p><p class=align-left>In addition, there exists a demand for the product in the international market from countries such as Germany. The export crop fetches from about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shs.55 per kilogram</a>, and farming for business is lucrative.</p><h2>15. Pottery business</h2><p class=align-left>Making artefacts and pottery for sale is another business one could start in rural areas. The availability of clay to make the items is a necessitating condition, coupled with the use of firewood to do most cooking.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs62f65032rt.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Guidelines on How to Succeed in Commercial Potato Farming in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Clay pottery is a suitable cooking option due to its durability; hence, a market exists.
