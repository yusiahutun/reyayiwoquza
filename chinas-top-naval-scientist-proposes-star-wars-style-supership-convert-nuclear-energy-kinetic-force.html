Their primary role is to provide air support for naval operations, rather than engaging in direct combat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The super warship is armed with new electromagnetic weapons such as rail guns, coilguns, rocket launchers, laser weapons and high-powered microwaves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ship’s advanced technology “cleverly and effectively transform the energy from the ship’s power source into the electromagnetic energy needed to power high-powered weapons,” according to the paper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This could give a single warship the ability to accurately defend against air attacks, engage in anti-submarine warfare, intercept missiles and deliver precise strikes on both naval and land targets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a result, a single all-purpose ship can perform the traditional tasks of a fleet of conventional ships,” Ma said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At present, nuclear energy cannot be used as a weapon in conventional warfare.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">EU cuts Chinese firms from sanctions list over flow of military goods to Russia</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The supership’s comprehensive nuclear-powered electromagnetic system could convert nuclear energy into usable kinetic energy or electricity to drive high-energy weapons systems, Ma’s team said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The paper said the electromagnetic rail guns on board, for instance, had a long reach and could hit targets in near space with guided ordnance at up to seven times the speed of sound.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The electromagnetic-launched missiles could be automatically reloaded like an automatic rifle and allowed far greater speed and number of missiles to be fired than those of adversaries, the researchers said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And the electromagnetic coilguns could launch different types of underwater weapons, significantly enhancing the ship’s capabilities for underwater attacks and defence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Laser weapons use the speed of light to transmit energy, allowing for extremely accurate targeting. On the other hand, high-powered microwave weapons have a broad impact area and are effective in countering multiple targets simultaneously.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thanks to the nearly endless supply of nuclear energy and advanced power management system, the supership will also be equipped with powerful radars and other power-hungry sensors to detect the enemy from a greater distance than ever before, according to the paper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ma’s team did not estimate when the supership would be built, but it said China was ready to take the idea from science fiction to the real world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the paper, the naval researchers listed recent breakthroughs in China that would pave the way for the ship’s construction. Some were declassified for the first time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese navy, for instance, has developed and implemented an electromagnetic launch system for weapon payloads on various types of combat platforms, including vehicles, ships, and submarines, according to Ma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At present, China has solved all the key technologies of the electromagnetic launch system for weapon payloads on various types of combat platforms, including vehicle-mounted, shipborne and underwater systems,” he said in the paper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The electric launch missile system is a type of system that uses electromagnetic energy to launch missiles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the main advantages of the electric launch missile system is that it allows for rapid and repeated firing of missiles. Unlike traditional missile launch systems, which typically require a significant amount of time to reload and prepare for firing, the electric launch missile system can be automatically reloaded, allowing for rapid and sustained firing of missiles.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/06/05/clean-thumb_5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:45</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China, US offer competing security visions for Asia-Pacific at security forum</p><p>China, US offer competing security visions for Asia-Pacific at security forum</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If a traditional aircraft carrier fleet is approaching the supership with the intention of launching a coordinated attack, the supership could respond by using its electric missile launch system to launch a barrage of missiles at the carrier fleet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The speed and accuracy of the electric missile launch system would make it difficult for the carrier fleet to evade or defend against the incoming missiles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The advantage of the electric missile launch system over a traditional missile launch system is similar to the advantage of an automatic rifle over a single-shot rifle, allowing for more rapid and effective engagement of targets, which could decide the outcome of a naval battle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is so far the only country that has carried out firing experiments of a large rail gun at sea. The Naval University of Engineering in China has recently achieved several significant breakthroughs in the development of smaller electromagnetic guns, according to Ma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These advancements include making the launch device and power supply lighter, integrating the electromagnetic gun weapon system into vehicles, and using projectile matching and electromagnetic spin-up technology to enhance shooting accuracy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Long-range field tests with [the] bullet exit kinetic energy of tens of kilojoules have been completed, which broke the range and kinetic energy record of current firearms in the world,” said Ma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A typical 9mm handgun bullet has a muzzle energy of around 500 joules. This means that the electromagnetic gun developed by China has at least 100 times or so more killing energy than a typical 9mm handgun.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is also currently developing electromagnetic coil launch technology that can launch a projectile at up to 1,000 metres (3,280 feet) per second, or more than three times the speed of sound, according to the paper.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">US Navy’s ‘Lightning carrier concept’ has lessons for China’s military</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coilguns use a series of electromagnetic coils to accelerate the projectile, while rail guns use parallel rails to create a magnetic field that propels the projectile. This difference in design makes coilguns easier to build and maintain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ma said the application of electromagnetic launch technology in the Chinese navy in recent years was the result of more than two decades of hard work and intense competition with rivals in the West.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The United States had … been a leader in this field since the 1980s,” he said. But from the turn of the millennium, Chinese scientists have received more persistent support from their government than their competitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The CG(X) project, for instance, was a US Navy programme to develop a new class of guided missile cruisers, which would have been equipped with advanced weapons systems, including electromagnetic launch systems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The programme was cancelled in 2010 because of “technological requirements that were too high and costs that were too high”, Ma said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The US Navy’s rail gun programme was another project to develop a high-powered rail gun for use in future warfare. However, the programme has faced technical challenges related to power supply and heat dissipation, and has been scaled back in recent years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The US has faced some challenges in developing electromagnetic launch systems, and has had to scale back or cancel some projects because of technical challenges and budget constraints.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This has slowed US progress in this area, and has given China an opportunity to gain an advantage in the race to develop more advanced and effective electromagnetic launch systems.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/05/20/clean_3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:47</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China’s world-first drone-carrier capable of operating on its own</p><p>China’s world-first drone-carrier capable of operating on its own</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese navy, for example, has developed pulse energy storage modules that can store hundreds of kilojoules of energy and can be combined in a modular building block fashion to achieve total energy storage in the hundreds of megajoules, according to Ma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This represents a significant breakthrough in the development of high-capacity pulse energy storage systems for electromagnetic launch applications, with performance several times higher than similar systems used by the US Navy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China has also developed a GNC (guidance, navigation and control) module with high overload resistance for use in electromagnetic launch systems, Ma said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This module is designed to provide accurate guidance and control of the projectile during launch, even in high-overload scenarios where the projectile is subjected to extreme forces up to 35,000 times the force of gravity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A guided rail gun projectile can actively steer itself towards the intended target, compensating for factors such as wind, gravity or target movement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This improves the chances of hitting the target accurately, especially over long distances.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Is Japan eyeing troop presence in Manila to back Taiwan amid China tensions?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mass application of electromagnetic launch technology will encounter many challenges. China’s naval university established an electromagnetic launch engineering major as early as 2017.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The goal is to cultivate talent engaged in the design, production supervision and lifelong operation and maintenance management of electromagnetic launch equipment, according to Ma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This was a big step forward for electromagnetic energy equipment. It has moved from being just a theoretical concept to becoming a practical engineering reality,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JngXR9lGiaoaGelsBuwM6pZKeZppa5br%2FCopynrJmowW680ainqKuVqHq0wMCrZLCZoqh6tMDYpZxmq6WlsrO%2Fx6KnZpufo8OmvtNmpa6bnJqus3nEp5yrn6liuKq6xK2gnGWWpL%2BksQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
