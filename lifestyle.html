However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>Sex toy shopping is largely a to-each-their-own practice. Someone’s too strong is someone else’s too subtle; someone’s phenomenal is someone else’s eh. Given this, there are very few rules when it comes to <a href=# rel=noopener>sex toy shopping</a>. There’s no right or wrong way to do it—just right or wrong for you. Except that there are wrong ways to do it. At least, there’s one: Buying anal toys without flared bases is a categorical no-no. Ask any sex toy expert or gynecologist, and they’ll agree.</p><h2>Anal toys can be an excellent investment, no matter your anatomy.</h2><p>First things first: <a href=# rel=noopener>Anal play can feel great</a>—like, really great—no matter who’s receiving. That’s because the anus is rich in nerve endings. And since a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">those nerve endings are exclusively sensory</a> (meaning, they’re designed to pick up on physical sensations), your anus is basically a stimulation hotspot.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>Not to mention, <a href=# rel=noopener>anal play</a> can be a great way to explore targeted G-spot and P-spot action. The G-spot, as you well know, is a pleasure zone tucked away on the anterior wall of the vagina. The P-spot, also known as the prostate, is a small gland located between the bladder and the penis. Both of these areas are extremely sensitive and can result in immense pleasure when stimulated. And anal play can offer direct access to both.</p><h2>But buy an anal toy without a flared base, and you risk genuine (maybe even serious) injury.</h2><p>Though the anus can be an absolute treasure trove of pleasure, you can’t treat it exactly like you’d treat a vagina. Because, well, it isn’t one. A vagina is kind of like a cul-de-sac: It dead-ends at your cervix, so even if a sex toy gets lost inside you, it doesn’t have very far to go. Your anus is not a dead-end—quite the opposite. It connects to your rectum, which is part of your large intestine. So theoretically, a toy lost inside your anus could make its way up your intestines—and end up somewhere it’s definitely not supposed to be.</p><p>And yes, a toy could actually get lost inside your anus. Because when you orgasm, your muscles contract, and there can be a “vacuum effect,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Natasha Chinn, M.D., a New Jersey-based ob/gyn</a> tells StyleCaster. It’s totally normal for your muscles to contract during orgasm (put simply, that’s what an orgasm is). And it’s also totally normal for those contractions to be so intense that they create a “suction-type effect,” Dr. Chinn says. And that’s exactly why you should be thoughtful when shopping <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex-toys data-tag=sex-toys>sex toys</a>—because some sex toys are less likely to get engulfed than others.</p><p>“It is super important to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">only purchase anal toys with flared bases</a>,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Annabelle Knight, Lovehoney sexpert</a>, tells StyleCaster. “There is a very real risk of over-insertion if the toy doesn’t have a flared base.”</p><p>But what is a flared base, exactly? Many anal toys taper toward the bottom and then widen—a lot. And that wide part is exactly what we’re talking about when we say flared base. That flared base can come in the form of a T-bar (a horizontal bar at the bottom of the toy that makes it look like an upside-down T), a large ring, a suction cup—even the testicles you find on realistic dildos could get the job done.</p><p>Thankfully, most anal toys come with a built-in flared base. But a lot of vaginal toys don’t. So you can’t just repurpose your favorite vaginal dildo for anal play and expect things to go OK.</p><p>And for what it’s worth, if you do end up with a toy lost inside your rectum, Dr. Chinn recommends that you go to the emergency room immediately. “The longer you wait, the higher the chance that you’ll need more of a major surgery—and the higher the risk of damage,” she says. (If you lose a toy inside your vagina, you can also call your doctor. But they can usually “get it out with ease,” Dr. Chinn says, so there’s less risk of surgery or major damage.)</p><h2>Don’t worry—there are tons of flared-base anal toys on the market for you to choose from.</h2><p>Again, finding flared-base anal toys isn’t hard at all. Browse any sex toy <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a>’s anal section, and you’ll see flared base after flared base. There’s actually enough variety that you could develop preferences about which flared bases you like best.</p><p>Once you’ve met that baseline criteria—once you’ve found an anal toy with a flared base—there are a few other things to consider. “Body-safe, non-porous materials are best for hygiene and prevention of bacterial infection,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Jenni Skyler, Ph.D., Adam & Eve sexpert</a>, tells StyleCaster. “For pleasure, it’s good to start small—and maybe even get a toy that vibrates for a little extra pleasurable sensation.”</p><p>And don’t forget the lube. Though your vagina self-lubricates, your anus doesn’t. “So whether you’re inserting a toy, finger or penis you’ll definitely need to use a thick water-based anal lubricant…for long-lasting slip, comfort and safety,” Knight says. (You can try oil- or silicone-based lubes too, just remember that oil-based lubes can degrade condoms and that silicone-based lubes can degrade silicone toys.)</p><p>“For beginners, <a href=# rel=noopener>go slow, warm up the whole body</a>, and make sure the arousal of the receiver is super high before attempting penetration,” Dr. Skyler says. Go slow. Feel it out. Have fun. And of course, shop responsibly.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Slide in one bead at a time, stop whenever you want to, and use the handle to pull them out when you’re finished. More advanced players may want to pull more forcefully than beginners—but focus on doing what feels best for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-sex-toys-3.jpg><h2>Snug Plugs</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Snug Plugs</a> are an excellent investment for any beginner.

Explore the toys, one by one, to see what you prefer. And rest assured knowing each comes with an expert-approved flared base (except the finger sleeve, but as long as you keep it on your finger as intended, you should be in the clear). <strong>(Adam & Eve sexpert Dr. Jenni Skyler recommends this toy for beginners.)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-sex-toys-5.jpg><h2>Petite Sensations Bubbles</h2><p>In addition to looking incredibly cool, the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Petite Sensations Bubbles</a> is beloved my those who’ve used it. The bubble-lined shaft offers the same versatility as anal beads, while the removable bullet vibrator at the base allows you to up the stimulation as you please.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-sex-toys-6.png><h2>Naughty Candy Heart Butt Plug</h2><p>In the case of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Naughty Candy Heart Butt Plug</a>, the flared base doubles as a command. Each base is shaped like a heart and inscribed with a pithy phrase, like “Be Mine,” Spank Me,” or “Do Me Now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-toys-2.png><h2>Adam & Eve Booty Boot Camp Training Kit</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">This starter kit</a> comes with three butt plugs of different sizes, so you can start small and work your way up. Each toy comes with a tapered tip for ease of penetration. And of course, all three come with flared (suction!) bases. <strong>(Adam & Eve sexpert Dr. Jenni Skyler recommends this toy for beginners.)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-sex-toys-7.jpg><h2>Pfun Plug</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Pfun Plug</a> is shaped to target the G-spot—or the P-spot—of whoever’s wearing it. It’s also crafted from stainless steel, a heavy material that leaves the toy feeling heavy (in a good way) and that lends itself to temperature play. (Run the toy under warm or cool water, and explore the sensations that await.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-sex-toys-9.png><h2>Luxe Wearable Vibra Plug</h2><p>Whereas most butt plugs come with a tapered end that makes penetration more gradual, the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vibra Plug</a> goes all in. Not for the faint of heart, the Vibra will certainly delight on entry. And its hollow form leaves it lightweight enough to leave in all day long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-sex-toys-10.jpg><h2>Aneros Progasm Ice Prostate Massager</h2><p>Super-fans of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Aneros Progasm Ice Prostate Massager</a> call it “the best of the best.” Though it was designed with prostate massage in mind, the toy’s sleek form lends itself just as well to G-spot stimulation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anal-sex-toys-11.jpg><h2>Bunny Tail Plug</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bunny Tail Plug</a> is proof that flared bases don’t have to be a buzzkill.
