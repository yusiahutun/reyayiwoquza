He was already a popular musician and focused on his music career after leaving the television series.&nbsp;</p><p>Early in the show, he was the only character the audience was rooting for, as everyone else was just plain dislikable. Unfortunately, Carmichael left for his heavenly abode on 27th December in 1981.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Crawford Jr</h3><p><a href=# data-type=post data-id=2311>Robert played the character of Andy Sherman</a> and was only seen as a recurring character in the first season.

The cause of his death was revealed to be a stroke.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did Laramie end?</h2><p>Laramie&nbsp;was one of those shows that acquired a greater fanbase after it ended.&nbsp;</p><p>During its run, the series was always hanging by a thread with the network.&nbsp;</p><p>They had a loyal fanbase, but it wasn’t that great in numbers. Eventually, in 1963, NBC decided to ax the show due to low ratings. After the television series ended, many people discovered it on DVDs.&nbsp;</p><p>As time went on, the Western genre got completely wiped out. In the 70s, the world got introduced to soap operas.&nbsp;</p><p>They were either drama or romance. In the late 80s, comedy became a huge seller for advertisers, and throughout the 90s, it remained the ultimate audience puller.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, with the emergence of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon, things are changing. Show creators are getting more courageous with their ideas, while dusty TV westerns from way back find their way into our hearts for a second shot at glory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYsSiv4ylmKuZnZ6ybq%2FAp5qepJyasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
