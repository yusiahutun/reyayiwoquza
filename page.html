Something happens when you mix otherwise one-dimensional ground meats up with fresh breadcrumbs, herbs, seasonings and make a great sauce to go with it and that is that I will swat your fork away to get at them first. I always believed I held no such adoration for meatloaf until I mentioned this one day — here, on my invisible soapbox — and someone in the comments asked gently, as if they understood they were speaking to a very easily confused individual, if I knew that meatloaf is basically one giant meatball?<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4591 height=3059 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/02/small-batch-tiramisu.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Please tell me this doesn’t just happen to me: You know when you love a dish so much, you don’t even want to risk ordering it when you’re out because it’s so often disappointing? Hopeless child of the 80s and 90s that I am, tiramisu is a top five dessert for me but I almost never eat it for this messy reason. At its finest, little bits of cake are almost saturated with bracing espresso then burrowed in a cream that’s ethereally light and fluffy for containing an unholy amount of mascarpone and dusted generously with cocoa or shaved unsweetened chocolate between each layer. The sum of the parts isn’t overly sweet but quite rich, ideal in small doses. It is heaven.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4029 height=2686 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/02/broccoli-pizza.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> “What the heck is that?”<br>“Who puts broccoli on pizza?”<br>“Congratulations Smitten Kitchen, <a href=#>you’ve ruined pizza</a>!”<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4374 height=2916 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/02/guacamole.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I have very strong opinions about guacamole. Fortunately for all of our sakes, this isn’t the kind of site devoted to didactic culinary lectures; it’s not that my way is right and your way is wrong. [Don’t I sound so <a href=#>mature</a> today?] If you love guacamole with chopped tomatoes, or red onion instead of white, lemon instead of lime or, like a former president of the United States, <a href=#>with garlic in it</a> (shudder), you should just go ahead and keep doing you. You’re cooking for you, not me. And I will eat it, preferably with a salt-rimmed margarita or paloma. I have never turned guacamole away; I am not a monster.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4664 height=3109 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/01/an-easier-way-to-make-cookies.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Tips</span></a> Pretty much everything terrible about making cookies comes down to one thing: deciding you want a cookie and realizing that the expanse between now and when you get to eat said is unfairly wide.<p>For example:<br>•Butter needs to be softened. Is your kitchen really cold today? Have fun with that.<br>•The butter needs to be “creamed” with sugar until “light and fluffy.” Some recipes want you to do this for many, many minutes. Some recipes think you are bored.<br>•Once your dough is made, it needs to be formed into packets and chilled in the fridge for “at least two hours” but “preferably overnight.” Remember when you said you wanted a cookie? You meant tomorrow, right?</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5138 height=3425 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/01/spaghetti-carbonara-pie-for-fn.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Announcements</span></a><p>Have you ever wanted to go behind the scenes here at the Smitten Kitchen? Like, really behind the scenes, watching me cook, listening to me chatter about how the recipe came about and grimacing at my terrible knife skills? Phew, I was hoping you would say no because I’m excruciatingly awkward in person and also on camera and since we all agree, you can just come back in a day or two and we’ll proceed with a new recipe like we always do.

Did you find a pair of boots that you love but they’re wildly expensive? Text me and I will tell you about the only time in my life I have splurged on boots and how lovely they are. Were you having a nostalgic conversation with a friend about boxed macaroni and cheese and now you’re craving it? I say you’re basically obligated to reunite with it once in a while as an adult for, like, reassessment. But that’s my base level of rationalizing; what I did last weekend was Olympic.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5082 height=3388 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/01/crusty-baked-cauliflower-and-farro.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I have been thinking about how it might be cool to do a baked pasta dish in which we swap the noodles for farro but leave all the great parts like cheese, so much cheese, chunks of vegetable and, most hopefully, a crunchy lid for years. Years! In that time, I have cooked hundreds of other things, some even <a href=#>not terrible</a>, even, but it took until I handed my husband the latest Ina Garten cookbook and told him to pick out some things we should eat and he pointed to her recipe for crusty shells and cheese that I thought “This!” I last felt this urgently about swapping pasta for a grain when we made <a href=#>this</a>, three and a half years ago.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4636 height=3091 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/01/chicken-wonton-soup.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I don’t know why it took me so long to make this as it combines the only two things I ever want when I’m sick: chicken noodle and wonton soup. The thing is, when you’re sick, you absolutely do not want to cook anything. (Also sometimes when we’re well, to be completely honest. Shh, don’t tell anyone.) And so for a couple nights, we picked up a decent chicken noodle soup in the neighborhood, but when we tired of that, ordered wonton soup instead. It’s usually a disappointment. Sometimes it seems like a quart of bland broth with three floating pockets in it, not the most filling meal. Plus, it’s off the menu for anyone who doesn’t eat pork or shrimp. But this one was not; it was chicken wontons in chicken broth and it was exceptional, the happiest mashup of the two wonderful things.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5616 height=3744 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2016/12/pimento-cheese-potato-bites.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a><p>Sorry, I blinked and missed 2016 in that way that happens when you’re so deeply in it, you forget to look up. I went from having one kid and a tiny bundle wrapped in a blanket to have two <a href=#>real-live mobile children</a> and they are impossibly cute and exhausting and I wouldn’t want it any other way except for maybe once a week if we can find a babysitter. Like all parents ever, I think my seven year-old <a href=#>says</a> <a href=#>amazing</a> <a href=#>things</a>, such as when he told us this weekend we needed to get our New Year’s Revolutions ready. My 17-month old is a tempest of curls and a blur of frenetic energy and whenever she exhibits, ahem, “low frustration tolerance” people decide this is the perfect time to tell me how much we are alike, not sure what that’s about… Both kids got serious <a href=#>birthday</a> <a href=#>cakes</a> and for once, <a href=#>my husband did alright too</a>. I got to go on a surprise birthday trip to <a href=#>Mexico City</a> without kids (!) and then we went to <a href=#>Portugal</a> with two children, had a great time, and even remembered to bring the same two children home with us. If we can do that, we can do anything, right?</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnxzg44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
