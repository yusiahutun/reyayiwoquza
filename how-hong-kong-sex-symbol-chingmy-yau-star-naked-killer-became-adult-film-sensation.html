I’m just moving into different areas of acting. I’m not going to limit myself to making the same movies again and again. I’m trying different, more varied roles.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Post noted that it had heard Naked Killer was “a startling departure from her previous roles, featuring scenes of lesbianism, and her character’s acute hatred of men”, but Yau, who later accepted her Category III status, was unmoved.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even though it’s a Category III film, little of me is seen in the sexy scenes. We discussed these aspects of the film before I started, and we compromised on exactly what I would or wouldn’t show,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/3951373b-4154-4a0f-b5d1-8011868018f9_b7585b70.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for the racy poster, she did it for the sake of the movie.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I really wanted those shots to look sexy, to help make people interested in the film. When the shots for the ads were taken, we had a female photographer, so I wasn’t too uncomfortable posing,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yau actually did show quite a lot in the film’s “sexy scenes” – although she never showed everything in any of her Category III films.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The trouble with a lot of sex and violence films is that there’s usually not enough of either,” wrote Rick Baker and Toby Russell in The Essential Guide to Hong Kong Movies, which has a section devoted to Category III movies. “However, that’s a dilemma that Naked Killer remedies with a vengeance.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/23cd4566-7346-4714-ab8c-fa4075735ee1_3b0a0f13.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sex scenes, some of which were trimmed for the international release, are soft porn, and a much-discussed “highlight” of the film is when one of the characters mistakes a dismembered penis for a hot-dog sausage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yau’s unrestrained performance quickly saw her become a sex symbol in Hong Kong, and she went on to make more Category III exploitation films like the tawdry and unsavoury Raped by an Angel. This nasty little film was billed as a sequel to Naked Killer even though the story bore little relation to it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Category III films, which at the time generally mixed soft-core sex, extreme violence, gore and crude humour, were still relatively new in 1992, as the rating had only come into existence in 1988, but the genre was booming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Along with the voluptuous Amy Yip Chi-mei, Hong Kong’s first modern sex symbol, and Veronica Yip Yuk-hing, the first Hong Kong actress to appear fully nude on screen, Yau become one of the genre’s top stars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An alleged romantic affair with prolific super-producer Wong Jing, who made a mint by dabbling in all styles of trashy movies, led to suggestions that Yau had no trouble snagging such roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/99739275-e45b-46d1-ae38-49406b964394_f2c4bc8f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wong sometimes appeared in Yau’s films as an actor, and reportedly protected her, ensuring that there were always some strategically placed props to make sure she wasn’t fully exposed to the cameras.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yau’s Category III reputation did not hurt her career – in fact, it jump-started it. She was pretty, and that was considered a virtue at the time in Hong Kong, so women didn’t take against her, although she didn’t win a female following like Veronica Yip did when she went mainstream.</p>Yau appeared in many non-Category III films, such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Jackie Chan</span></a>’s City Hunter and the “trendy triad” movie <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Young and Dangerous 2</span></a>, and she became one of Hong Kong’s most recognisable actresses.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was even nominated for a best actress award at the Hong Kong Film Awards in 1996, for the romantic comedy I’m Your Birthday Cake, although she lost to the eminent Josephine Siao Fong-fong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/bafe655e-fa54-4335-a36a-5a41b25b27a5_5925a5bb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But filmmakers were always keen to capitalise on her looks, even for mainstream films. In an interview in 1996, the Post noted that in the promotional posters for her movies, she often appeared in “suggestive or even semi-nude poses”, even if such scenes did not appear in the actual film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The star was upfront about the reason: “I may look very sexy in some promotional posters, but from a commercial viewpoint, the purpose of that is to attract people’s attention. The image may have nothing to do with the plot. Commercial films have to sell.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yau, who said she had always liked to “show off”, started working as a model when she was at school and continued after she left. She appeared in around 100 adverts, publicising everything from food to cosmetics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/279adc30-2aca-4ad8-8f05-8cdbd76afc26_5925a5bb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was so successful she became overexposed – clients, she said, claimed that the adverts she appeared in promoted her, and not the product.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the advertising work dried up, she entered the Miss Hong Kong beauty pageant and reached the finals. She dropped out before the competition ended and started working in the film industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even though Yau has been in a lot of iconic Hong Kong movies, she was almost never the lead in any of them,” notes cultural commentator and Post contributor Ben Sin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But she was in so many Hong Kong movies during the industry’s peak times, she became one of the most well-known faces of that era. Anyone who watched Hong Kong movies during the 1990s would instantly recognise her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/02/ac4ec1bf-9547-4eb5-8e16-18142f56ee38_0ff026f9.jpg>Yau did manage to achieve top billing in her last film, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Stanley Kwan Kam-pang</span></a>’s 1998 art-house drama Hold You Tight. She essayed a dual role with ease, and garnered a well-deserved Hong Kong Film Awards nomination.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Absent from the media for a long time, she recently received some press attention thanks to her youthful looks at age 54.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this regular feature series on the best of Hong Kong cinema, we examine the legacy of classic films, re-evaluate the careers of its greatest stars, and revisit some of the lesser-known aspects of the beloved industry.</p>Want more articles like this?
