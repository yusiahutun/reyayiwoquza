The couple's rings, from <strong>Siera Jewelry</strong>, were also custom made.</p><p>66 friends and family members were in attendance for the beautiful ceremony, including bridesmaid and <strong>"General Hospital"</strong> star <strong>Kimberly McCullough</strong>. Other guests included <strong>"Skyline"</strong> star <strong>Tanya Newbould</strong> -- who introduced the couple -- and <strong>"Dark Angel's" </strong><strong>Jennifer Blanc-Biehn</strong>.</p><p>Harris, now 36, <a href=#><strong>talked to toofab about the wedding back in October </strong></a>-- where she assured us it would be a fairly traditional affair, despite her background in horror.</p><p><span>"What makes you think it won't be typical??!! I'm wearing a wedding dress, it's not white, but it isn't black either," she said at the time. "I have rented farm tables, chandeliers from trees, flower girls, a band playing The Eagles and Jim Croce and I'm getting married under a </span>huppah<span> by a Rabbi for God's sake."</span></p><p><span>"I think it's funny that people assume I'm gonna be covered in blood walking down the aisle or something," she adds. "I'm actually pretty normal considering the crazy childhood I've had and what I've been exposed to. See, not every kid that is exposed to slasher movies at a young age goes on a killing spree in their small town or has small animals dismembered in a freezer in their grandparents' basement!"</span></p><p><span>Check out more photos from their Hawaiian wedding in the gallery above -- and see how more famous horror movie kids have aged below!</span></p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/82/o/2013/10/21/82cc06ec8f8359cd9fb4c19b520c2d17_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnV7j2pmaW9fma6vtcSlo55lmJa%2Fs7XSZq6enJSeu6h5w6ucrKtdpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
