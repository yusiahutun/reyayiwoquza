Just a quick glance at the black carpet showed the likes of <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, Kanye West, and even Barack Obama at the premiere. But upon closer investigation, it was clear the rapper, 24, hired Hollywood’s finest <a href=#>celebrity</a> lookalikes.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1661377822-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-nas-x-s-j-christ-premiere-featured-taylor-swift-and-a-questionable-ice-spice>Lil Nas X’s J Christ premiere featured Taylor Swift and a questionable Ice Spice</h2><p>Lil Nas X blasted onto the music scene as a cowboy rapper with Old Town Road but four years later, his image couldn’t be any more different. Think prison shower scenes with little left to the imagination, proud LGBTQ imagery, and ‘devil’ shoes with real blood. Biblical references have been a theme throughout the rapper’s recent string of hits, but his latest track, J Christ, is gaining negative attention for its fake star-studded lineup.</p><p>On Thursday, Lil Nas – real name Montero Lamar Hill – teased his heavenly new song on <a href=#>Instagram</a> with a video showing impersonators of Ed Sheeran, Obama, Taylor Swift, and <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> wearing white as they walked upstairs leading to the skies.</p><p>The teaser stars made their IRL appearance at the song premiere, and we have to say, the resemblances are uncanny – particularly fake Obama’s voice.</p><p>However, the <a href=#>Ice Spice</a> double was a little questionable. The Industry Baby singer hired a man wearing a white halterneck top and denim shorts – and the only similar trait was the orange curly wig.</p><p>The fake celeb cameos has the internet branding Lil Nas as an attention-seeker since his music video always invite debate.</p><p>“Lil Nas X is so desperate for attention that he decides to take a controversial route. You’re not Lady Gaga, hun. This is not art, this is blasphemy,” one tweeted about the J Christ cover art showing the rapper lying on Jesus’ cross.</p><p>A second person agreed: “Lil Nas X ain’t even tastefully or naturally controversial. He just wants attention and we giving it to him, not for too long tho. He doing too much.”</p><p>Christian rapper Bryon Grey also called out the flamboyant artist, accusing Lil Nax of “mocking Christianity.”</p><p>“He’s doing it with the goal to mock us because that’s how he gets his clicks,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Fox News.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-nas-isn-t-playing-he-ll-be-studying-christian-leadership>Lil Nas isn’t playing – he’ll be ‘studying’ Christian leadership</h2><p>The Grammy-nominated singer had the ultimate response to haters offended with his music laced with religious imagery. On Wednesday, Lil Nas posted an acceptance letter to Liberty University claiming he had been inducted to their Dual Concentration in Christian Leadership and Biblical Studies course.</p><p>“I know some of y’all hate me right now but I want y’all to know I’m literally about to go to college for biblical studies in the fall. Not everything is a troll!” he wrote.</p><p>Actually, he may be trolling because Liberty University later denied the acceptance letter.</p><p>“We can confirm that Liberty University did not issue the Montero Hill ‘acceptance letter’ posted yesterday to social media, and we have no record of Montero Hill applying to the university,” they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Billboard.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2FcLjIpWSnmaNixW6vwKWjnpxdmbK0vMSrmK2dXZu8s3nHoqmippdiwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecCnm2ajkaPGpnnWnqqtZZmivaa%2B0qilmqyfp8Bw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
