These ways will make him desire you even after a long workday. It is not rocket <a href=#>science</a> to achieve this, but you may drive him away if you don't play your cards well. Below are ways to make your husband want you all the time:</p><h3>1. Create time to do fun things together</h3><p class=align-left>As years pass into your marriage, you may find yourself forgetting to have fun. This can make your husband lose interest in you and look for someone he can have fun with. Don't get so immersed in other chores that you forget having fun with the man you love.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish? Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690.</strong></p><p class=align-left>You will make your husband respect you more if you can balance your time for chores and him. Being in a marriage for long comes with a good share of its boring staff, especially when everything is routine. However, just because you are married does not mean that you should not do all the fun things you used to do before.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf339000f4853033.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to stop loving the father of your child as a single mom</span></p></a><h3>2. Let him be the hero of your life</h3><p class=align-left>Your husband may stop wanting you if you can’t make him feel like he has earned your respect. To be on the safe side, you have to make him feel like a hero, which will attract your husband to you. If you make the mistake of thinking that you don't need anyone to rescue you, then you might lose your husband forever.</p><p class=align-left>There is something that makes men seek those <a href=#>relationships</a> that make them feel like heroes. They long to be admired and do anything to draw that feeling from their wives. A man won't be comfortable in a marriage that satisfies his thirst.</p><h3>3. Give him a warm hug and greeting every time you see him</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg><p class=align-left>Greetings and goodbyes are routines most couples stick to for the rest of their lives. The problem is that it tends to become a pretty dull habit because nothing changes. After all, it is a routine. However, what you may not know is that how you say goodbye to your husband in the<a href=#> morning </a>may have an impact on whether he will have a good day or not.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the same way, how you welcome him will determine his attitude in the house. By giving your husband a warm hug and a kiss every time you see him, you will be making him feel fantastic about himself. As a result, he will always look forward to the moment he reaches home after work because he knows he will be welcomed like a king.</p><h3>4. Make him feel needed</h3><p class=align-left>Make your husband love you again when he wants a divorce by making him feel needed. Women of today have the urge to be independent, but that should not hinder making your man feel needed. Naturally, men have an instinct to protect women and make them feel secure.</p><p class=align-left>Any man will act on a woman's need for protection as long as he feels wanted. If you give your husband the idea that you don't need him in your life, he may lose confidence in himself and the relationship. The trick is to get him to do something for you, and he will be locked in forever.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/587017031e0f5b1e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to graduate from a side chick to main chick</span></p></a><h3>5. Love yourself</h3><p class=align-left>You have probably been told that nobody can love you if you can't love yourself. If you don't love yourself, you think you are not worthy of it, and you will give your husband the same impression. This will hinder you from building a healthy and long-lasting relationship.</p><p class=align-left>You can love yourself with simple things such as pampering yourself with nice clothes and ensuring that you constantly improve your image. The confidence in yourself will make you more attractive to your husband. He will be yearning to be with you all the time because you will always surprise him at how amazing you can be.</p><h3>6. Let him miss you</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf339000f4853033.jpg><p class=align-left>As strange as it may sound, you need to make your husband miss you if you want him to long for you all the time. You may have heard that you should spend more time together to create an everlasting bond, but that is not always the case. That can result in boredom which won’t be productive from the perspective of the <a href=#>relationship</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsh3j06p7a3g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>6 tips on how to get over someone you like fast</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Spending some time apart can be healthy for couples, especially those that have been together for a long time. It allows both parties to live their lives independently hence their growth as individuals. This will give you more to talk about when you get together, and you may even discover new things about each other.</p><h3>7. Develop a habit of saying thank you</h3><p class=align-left>It is the simple things that will make your husband want you all the time, and one of those things is to say thank you. It is human nature to want to feel appreciated, and it is a trick that can work tremendously in your favour. The problem is that it reaches a point in a marriage you may think you are entitled to things from your husband that you don't show any appreciation for.</p><p class=align-left>To strengthen your marriage, start thanking your husband whenever he does something for you, no matter how small it is. This will encourage him to do even bigger things for you and make your love flourish because you are investing in it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3m7e6t7ss3jg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Romantic sweet words for her</span></p></a><h3>8. Support him from the sidelines</h3><p class=align-left>Being a man is not as easy as you may think; hence your support is much needed. He is the provider in the relationship and the rock on which the entire <a href=#>family</a> leans under challenging times. As a man, he will strive not to show any signs of weakness, even when hurting.</p><p class=align-left>Because he has so much to handle on his shoulders, he may grow cold, which will impact the marriage. With your full support, things will be easier on him; hence you won't have an irritable husband. However, never should you take his place in your quest to support him because that will drain all his confidence.</p><h3>9. Do not try to change him</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ee9bae23d4834bea.jpg><p class=align-left>If you married your husband the way he is, you should accept him with his flaws. Even if he were perfect at the start, as you spend a lot of time with him, you would find some things about him annoying. Nothing gives you the license to try changing him because that is who he is.</p><p class=align-left>It is not easy for people to change, and some may even prefer to abandon marriage instead of changing. The more you pressure such people, the more they will resist, creating friction in the <a href=#>marriage</a>. If you want him to continue loving you, just let him be how he wants to be.</p><h3>10. Cook for him his best meals</h3><p class=align-left>Whoever said that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach was spot on. Cooking is one quality men admire, and they will love you for it. The mere act of cooking his favourite meal will make your husband feel special.</p><p class=align-left>You don't have to be the greatest cook in the <a href=#>world</a> to impress your husband. If you made an effort to cook something he likes, the chances are that he will appreciate the gesture. This will encourage him to join you in the kitchen to cook together. That is a big win because your love will blossom to greater heights.</p><h3>11. A warm bath can rekindle your intimacy</h3><p class=align-left>Don't let your husband go into the shower alone and bathe with cold water. Instead, get in there with him and seek his help to undress you. Make the bath playful as you rub his back and let him caress you.</p><p class=align-left>There are many ways to make this moment magical for both of you. For instance, you can make it seductive by adding some aromatic room freshener. You can also bring some flowers into the bathroom, which will lighten up the mood.</p><p class=align-left>There is no shortcut on how to make your husband want you all the time. You must be willing to put in the hard work to see the results. Your husband will appreciate the effort and try his best to make things work. If you succeed in making your husband want you every day, you will discover the keys to a happy marriage.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> shared an interesting article about how to<a href=#> make a guy chase you</a> by text.
