And I truly believe she taught me so much about finding joy and I feel such joy again in my life. You know, I’ve gone through so many different things in my life, but, yeah, pretty amazing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Florence-Robert-Brady-Bunch.jpg><p>The Brady Bunch kids — which also includes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Barry Williams</strong></a> (Greg Brady), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Christopher Knight</strong></a> (Peter Brady), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mike Lookinland</strong></a> (Bobby Brady) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Eve Plumb</strong></a> (Jan Brady), and <strong>Susan Olsen</strong> (Cindy Brady) — will soon reunite and return to their classic TV home in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Very Brady Renovation</a>, which premieres September 9th on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HGTV</a>.
