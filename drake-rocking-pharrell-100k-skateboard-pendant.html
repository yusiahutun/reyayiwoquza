The chain was one of 20 Jacob & Co. pieces sold in the auction. The double skateboard netted $103,750 and it looks like Drake was the lucky buyer.</p><p>“Spiritually it’s a very rich experience, an enlightening experience to let…stories go,” Pharrell said at the time of the auction.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Complex</a>, the “22 karat gold piece features white, pink, and yellow diamonds and weighs approximately 401 grams.”</p><p>The auction lot provided a history of the chain’s inspiration: “When everyone in the game was flipping it regular, P did it switch. Pharrell’s interpretation of a Jesus Piece was two 18K gold (fully functional) fingerboard-sized skateboards, complete with nearly 2,000 round, brilliant diamonds, dangling from a 26” 22K chain. One of the decks features a diamond depiction of Jesus, while the other features a diamond cross. If Skateboard P had a signature chain, this might have been it.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/12/drake-new-chain-focuses-on-every-time-he-thought-of-engagement-250x142.png alt="Drake's New Chain Commemorates His 42 Failed Marriage Proposals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Drake's New Chain Commemorates His 42 Failed Marriage Proposals</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 13, 2022</p></a><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Other rare items sold from Pharrell’s closet</a> include a “Women’s Rights” embroidered motorcycle jacket, a gold-and-diamond encrusted G-Shock watch, and a few gorgeous pendants.
