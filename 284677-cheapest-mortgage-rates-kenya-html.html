When starting your search for the best mortgage provider, it is crucial to start off with thorough research on all possible options different banks offer. The truth is, numerous mortgage providers are willing to help you become a homeowner, but not all providers have affordable rates. It is, therefore, the borrower's duty to research on current mortgage interest rates in Kenya.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/08ac58d772c64944.jpg><p class=align-left>Here are some simple tips for securing cheap mortgage rates in Kenya.</p><h2><strong>1. Property price</strong></h2><p class=align-left>According to real estate agents based in Nairobi, property prices in several neighborhoods in the city have doubled, and others even tripled, since 2006. For this reason, home buyers and future property owners are advised to carry out thorough research on property prices. One can employ the use of a housing finance consultant who can help you determine the most affordable property prices according to your income.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5c9bev2e1mu.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best bank in Kenya for loans, savings or asset financing</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The same situation is repeated in Mombasa. Both residential and commercial buildings are getting expensively being sold even before construction is completed. That is why property price should be known first.</p><h2><strong>2. One huge deposit or monthly deposits</strong></h2><p class=align-left>The age-old debate has always been whether it is better to reduce monthly mortgage repayments or to earn returns from another form of investment.</p><p class=align-left>When it comes to the deposit, money bank mortgage rates in Kenya operate on a simple principle. The higher the deposit, the lower the loan you will need to borrow. The lower the amount you need to hire, the more the interest rates available to you. According to <a href=# title="preparing for a mortgage" rel="nofollow noopener">several housing finance consultants</a>, it is always recommended to put down a deposit of at least 20% of the full payment.</p><h2><strong>3. The interest rates</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Interest rates in Kenya are set according to the amount to be borrowed and the duration of the loan. At this stage, you should take the time to ask as many questions as possible concerning interest rates and the options available to them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs4fvmssiq725.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Equity Bank Kenya loans and interest rates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For housing mortgage in Kenya interest rates, two factors are of the utmost importance - the current rate and future expectations of where rates will go.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Good news, Kenyans can now get unsecured business loans</strong></p><h2><strong>4. Monthly repayments</strong></h2><p class=align-left>At this stage, you must consult with a housing finance provider or confirm on Kenyan real estate websites with mortgage calculators. The monthly repayment are easily calculated using the interest rate, property price, and deposit. These mortgage calculators on real estate websites provide a fast and straightforward way of determining monthly payments.</p><h2><strong>5. Location of the property</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Often, in Kenya, houses in big cities are more likely to be covered by most commercial banks as compared to remote/ rural parts of the country. This is a trend often only seen with Kenyan banks. Very few banks agree to provide mortgage loans for rural homes.</p><p class=align-left>Finally, you must note that mortgage rates in Kenya today fall under two categories; fixed rate mortgages and adjustable rate mortgages. Fixed rate mortgages allow the borrower to owe a percentage of the loan as interest. On the other hand, adjustable mortgage rates in Kenya reflect changes in the credit market in the repayment rates. When it comes to applying for a mortgage, carrying out thorough research might end up saving you a lot of money. You must explore all the options offered by different banks before settling on an option.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/01445163b8be9803.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best loan apps in Kenya for genuine instant loans in 2024</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Equity Bank Kenya loans and interest rates</strong></li><li><strong>Stima Sacco contacts</strong></li><li><strong>Kenya treasury bills interest rate</strong></li><li><strong>Gross salary vs net salary comparison</strong></li><li><strong>Loan apps in Kenya</strong></li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Bl21tcG9dmLWmrc%2Beqq1lnaS%2FtbPAoJxmqpGpsrR5yp6lsplencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
