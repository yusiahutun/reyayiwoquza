Her passing has left a huge hole in our lives as a family. I miss her hugs. She was a unique character, always seeing the sunny side of life she had a wicked sense of humour and always laughed at my bad jokes. With her by my side, I was sure I could achieve anything. It was like having a superpower. Without Sammy, there would have been no Tenable Quiz show, no Willow series. No Idiot Abroad Series 3. (It was her suggestion that Ricky Gervais send me off with Karl) — I think she wanted me out of the house for a few weeks!”</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><p id=eAt2fZRH4JO data-wc=89>He announced that he was leaving social media on X, formerly known as Twitter, with a post that read: “ I’m done here, Sgning off.” (Sic). However, his post led to some concern from fans, and his children Annabelle, 27, and Harrison, 21, clarified the message via Warwick’s account, writing: “Thank you everyone for looking out for our Dad, he is taking some time away from social media. He apologises if his last message caused anyone concern. We appreciate all of your love and support, Annabelle and Harrison x.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a630aa881c91-warwick-davis-samantha.jpg><p id=ePfAU9XgeTa data-wc=45>Warwick and Sammy’s two children also shared a statement of their own following the loss of their mum, which read: “Her love and happiness carried us through our whole lives.
