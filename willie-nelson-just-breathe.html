Sure, fans knew the 78-year-old legend wouldn't be around forever, but no one was ever forced to acknowledge it. More than that, the Nelsons leave any well-balanced fan of country music hurting for his or her own lost loves -- or at the very least reaching for the shoulder of someone whose presence may have gone unacknowledged for too long.</p><p>"Stay with me / Let's just breathe." Six simple words with so much meaning float with small shadows over the gentle acoustic and moody steel guitars. "Did I say that I need you / Did I say that I want you / Oh if I didn't I'm a fool you see / No one knows this more than me / As I come clean."</p><p>It's hard to tell if the remainder of 'Heroes' (in stores May 15) will also carry the burden of Nelson's scars, but a quick peak at the track listing indicates a more diverse set of songs than the 'American Recordings' projects Cash put together before his death. 'Roll Me Up an Smoke Me When I Die' is hardly a swan song. Almost unnoticed is Lukas Nelson's performance, which proves him more than capable to carry on the Nelson legacy after his father retires to God's honkytonk.</p><figure class="img-tag alignleft"><p>5 Stars</p><p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Listen to Willie Nelson, 'Just Breathe'</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmsKGcobamec2eo6ynnmK3tr%2FTZpmrnZGptaZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
