The big country ballad stings the heart while reminding us of how the country veteran is capable of opening us up.</p><p>One can't help but double take at the song's powerful final chorus. Brooks&nbsp;starts soft and builds through this story of love and heartbreak. The singer plays a man jaded after making bad decisions in the face of difficulties. He's pleading with a younger man not to do the same, to open up instead of shutting down.</p><p>The tone, pace and overall style of "Ask Me How I Know" recalls "More Than a Memory," a chart-topper in 2007 penned by the&nbsp;then-unheard-of <a href=#>Lee Brice</a>. It could be a career-starter for Brooks' unheralded writer once again (see below), but more importantly for him, it's an emphatic country statement that demands to be recognized.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>: Country newcomer Mitch Rossell wrote "Ask Me How I Know." Brooks says they jokingly call him "diva" because he never asks for anything.</p><p><strong>Watch: Garth Brooks Talks About "Ask Me How I Know"</strong></p><h3>Garth Brooks, "Ask Me How I Know" Lyrics:</h3><p class=p1>You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down / You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around / You make all the rules, you're set in your ways / You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space.</p><p class=p1><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>'Cause one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find / Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time / Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you / And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride / Start building up your walls and never let her get inside / You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do / And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go / Ask me how I know.</p><p class=p1>Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong / Say I'm just another fool and this is just another song / But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am / And I'd give anything to go back and try again.</p><p class=p1>And you best put this song on repeat / Maybe then you won't end up like me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmiqbVurtGopqSrXZbArHnMnmShp6ditm63zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
