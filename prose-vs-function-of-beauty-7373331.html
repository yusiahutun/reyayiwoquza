But how many times did those shampoo and conditioners, regardless of the brand’s popularity, fall flat? While “customized” has become a favored buzzword in the beauty industry, particularly when it comes to hair care products, there’s still some validation to the idea. Because, let’s be frank, hair is very personal; there’s not—or at least shouldn’t be—a one-size-fits-all solution for the general population. and our precious locks deserve some attention.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to customized hair care, two companies that have propelled the movement forward are Prose and Function of Beauty. There are quite a few similarities between both companies, such as subscription options, natural ingredients, and product range, but they both have several key differences, too. Here, we compare Prose and Function of Beauty so that you can better decide which, if either, are a good fit for you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-prose></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Prose?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Established in France in 2017, but based out of Brooklyn, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="subid1=${DOC_ID}&subid2=${REQUEST_ID}">Prose</a> specializes in customized hair care products. Like other similar services, the experience begins with a “hair quiz” that asks typical questions about hair texture, oil and dryness level, hair loss, and more. But unlike many companies, Prose’s questionnaire dives a little deeper, covering topics like hair styling and treatments, diet, stress levels, and zip code, the last of which immediately generates information about your area’s environment (pollution, UV rays, water hardness, humidity, wind). Plus, each question, of which there are about 30, is accompanied by either a reason for why it’s being asked or a correlated fact, oftentimes explaining how something can affect your hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following your results, you’ll learn more about the ingredients that will be used in your customized product. Prose prides itself on utilizing natural ingredients devoid of parabens, sulfates, GMOs, mineral oils, and animal cruelty; supplements are also gluten-free. You’ll be provided with a list of product recommendations based on your hair and scalp needs, and then can purchase the items one time or on a subscription basis. Subscribers will receive Prose products on a monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly basis, and also receive a 15 percent discount and a free product for every 10 products purchased. The best part? Prose has a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee, so if you’re not happy with your results, you can request a full refund or request for an adjusted formula free of charge within 30 days of delivery.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-function-of-beauty></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Function of Beauty?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Founded in 2015 by two MIT engineers and a chemist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="sid=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">Function of Beauty</a> is often credited for being the company to popularize customizable hair care products. Its quick and easy quiz sticks to the basic questions, like hair type, scalp moisture, and hair goals. Once the results are processed, you’ll have the chance to learn more about the vegan and cruelty-free ingredients that’ll be used in your products. In addition to selecting your desired fragrance and fragrance strength, you’ll be able to personalize the bottle and choose the color for your shampoo and conditioner, adding an extra layer of customization.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When checking out, you’ll find a list of suggested products based on your quiz results and hair goals. While there’s an option to make a one-time purchase, subscribers benefit from perks that include free shipping and members-only discounts. Other hair care products, unfortunately, are not eligible for a discount on automatic monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly deliveries. However, like Prose, Function of Beauty offers full refunds within 30 days of receipt if you’re not happy with your order. And while the company is best known for hair care products, it has also expanded into body wash, lotion, and skincare since its inception, making it a one-stop shop for customizable beauty products.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-prose-vs-function-of-beauty-key-specs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Prose vs. Function of Beauty: Key Specs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-table mntl-sc-block-universal-table"><table class=mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table><tr><th>Specs</th><th>Prose</th><th>Function of Beauty</th></tr><tbody data-check=0 readability=15.5><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>$24</td><td>$27</td></tr><tr><td>Free shipping?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Influenster rating</td><td>4.2 out of 5 stars</td><td>4.4 out of 5 stars</td></tr><tr><td>Fragrance-free option?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Delivery frequency</td><td>Monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly</td><td>Monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly</td></tr><tr><td>Vegan ingredients?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=23><td>Products include</td><td>Shampoo, conditioner, scalp mask, hair mask, styling gel, hair supplements, hair oil, dry shampoo, leave-in conditioner, curl cream</td><td>Shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, leave-in conditioner, hair serum, styling primer, co-wash, purple shampoo, purple conditioner</td></tr></tbody></table><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-do-prose-and-function-of-beauty-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Do Prose and Function of Beauty Cost?</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Prose Plans & Pricing</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-table mntl-sc-block-universal-table"><table class=mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table><tr><th><b>Custom Product</b></th><th><b>Subscription Price</b></th></tr><tbody data-check=0><tr><td>Shampoo</td><td>$27.20</td></tr><tr><td>Conditioner&nbsp;</td><td>$27.20&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-shampoo scalp mask&nbsp;</td><td>$38.25&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-shampoo hair mask&nbsp;</td><td>$38.25&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Styling gel&nbsp;</td><td>$25.50&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Root Source™</td><td>$52.70&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Hair oil&nbsp;</td><td>$40.80&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Dry shampoo&nbsp;</td><td>$23.80&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Leave-in conditioner&nbsp;</td><td>$23.80&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Curl cream&nbsp;</td><td>$23.80&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Function of Beauty Plans & Pricing</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-table mntl-sc-block-universal-table" readability=46.366484517304><table class=mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table><tr><th><b>Custom Product</b></th><th><b>Price</b>&nbsp;</th></tr><tbody data-check=0><tr><td>Shampoo</td><td>$27</td></tr><tr><td>Conditioner&nbsp;</td><td>$27&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Hair mask&nbsp;</td><td>$24&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Leave-in conditioner&nbsp;</td><td>$24&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Hair serum&nbsp;</td><td>$29&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Styling Primer&nbsp;</td><td>$29&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Co-wash&nbsp;</td><td>$30&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Purple shampoo&nbsp;</td><td>$27&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Purple conditioner&nbsp;</td><td>$27&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Purple hair mask&nbsp;</td><td>$24&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><span class=heading-toc id=toc-prose-reviews></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Prose Reviews</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, Prose customers are content with their customized hair care products. Many note that they appreciate the extensive quiz, natural ingredients, scents (Botanica was singled out on several occasions), and the company’s sustainability efforts. Reviewers also rave about the results, saying that they’ve noticed healthier locks. Many have also commented that the products, most notably the curl cream, have been particularly beneficial for curly hair types. Aside from the shampoo and conditioner, additional popular products amongst reviewers include the pre-shampoo hair mask, which many said left their locks feeling soft, and the scalp mask, which greatly helped reduce oiliness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the higher price point, customers generally believe that Prose is worth the cost and will continue using the products, however, some wished that bigger discounts were offered to loyal customers.

You’ll likely find ingredients like aloe vera for hydration, bamboo charcoal for scalp detox, and grape seed oil for hair health. Many companies will also use silicone in their products, which helps tame frizz-prone hair and can help prevent tanging, but can build up on hair, causing dullness and dehydration. As a result, some brands will offer a silicone-free option.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What Are “Clean Ingredients?”</span></p><p>While there are no definitive guidelines or regulations that have been put in place for what makes a product “clean,” clean products are typically free of toxic chemicals and ingredients such as parabens and sulfates.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How Many Times per Week Should You Use Custom Hair Care Products?</span></p><p>Just like store-bought hair care products, frequency of use for custom products depends on your hair, scalp, and habits. For example, if you have oily hair or frequently work up a sweat exercising, daily use may be required. Normal and dry hair types might be able to go without washing for several days, while natural hair can be as little as a few times a month.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=4 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What Size Products Do You Get With Most Hair Care Subscriptions?</span></p><p>You’ll typically receive full-size products with hair care subscriptions, often starting from eight ounces for products like shampoo and conditioner.
