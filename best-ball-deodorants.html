Aftershave, cologne, deodorant, shaving cream… that was pretty much it. Times have changed, and there are now more <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>men’s grooming brands</a> than you can shake a stick at. Today, it’s honestly required to look after your appearance beyond a simple splash of cold water on your face every morning. That extends below the belt, too, which is why you need ball deodorant or ball spray.</p><p>*Record scratch* Wait, what? Yes, below-the-belt care is big business, and that’s where it gets even more specific. Ball spray. Ball deodorant. All things ball… refreshers.

It’s a brave new world, but one that can bolster your confidence, your hygiene (of course), and perhaps even your *ahem* performance. (These tips on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how to stop overthinking and be more present during sex</a> can certainly help.) After all, you’ll want to look good and feel good to play good.</p><p>“This shift in behavior can be largely attributed to changing societal norms around masculinity and self-care, and the breaking of longstanding taboos,” says MANSCAPED Chief Marketing Officer Marcelo Kertész.</p><p>While it might not be the first thing you talk about with your partner or certainly your buddies, it’s almost expected that your grooming routine in that area is on par with the rest of your routine overall. Kertész calls the category “desirable, popular, and aspirational for men,” and he notes that the company has focused on humor and community engagement “to help make these grooming practices a shared and open topic among men.”</p><p>When you think about it, it’s kind of a funny premise on the surface, but one that shouldn’t be overlooked. Add another step to your grooming routine in an area you might not have considered, and shop these picks for the best ball deodorants and ball sprays for men.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.88144329896907><h2><strong>Dollar Shave Club</strong> Ball Spray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dollar-Shave-Club-Ball-Spray.webp?w=650"><p>If you’re using tools to groom below the belt, you might as well have a fresh finishing touch, right?
