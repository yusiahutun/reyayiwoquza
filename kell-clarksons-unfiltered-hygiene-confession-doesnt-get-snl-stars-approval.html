The <a href=#>TV</a> star’s new book also sheds light on the ‘right’ shower hygiene and answers viral questions like the proper time to clean your teeth – before or in the shower?</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Kelly is not totally on board with Kenan’s ‘shower’ take and shares what she typically ends up doing but the former turns down the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s suggestion, joking that he would consider it ‘gross.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1823610166-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kell-clarkson-s-real-hygiene-routine-is-not-impressing-kenan-thompson>Kell Clarkson’s real hygiene routine is not impressing Kenan Thompson</h2><p>Followers on <a href=#>TikTok</a> have been strongly debating the right shower routine for ages and it seems like Kelly Clarkson’s take will add more fire to the raging debate! The 41-year-old <a href=#>music</a> icon shared her shower hygiene with the audience and Kenan Thompson in a new episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, revealing that she often ends up brushing her teeth in the shower when she is in a hurry.</p><p>Kenan is polite in not showing his ‘approval’ as he says, “That’s fine, ’cause that’s where you are in the world. I’m on the whole other side where I find it gross. I don’t do it.”</p><p>The banter about shower routine goes further when Kenan talks about another topic ‘washing your legs in the shower’ and the right way to clean your ankles. Kelly seems to oppose that too, saying, “When you are washing up here, it does wash down” hinting that there may not be a need to go all the way down there and clean it. Kenan chooses to call a truce saying, ‘Different approaches.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1821352384-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-open-book-kelly-has-fans-approval>‘Open book’ Kelly has fans’ approval</h2><p>The unfiltered Kelly Clarkson’s questions like “Do you pee in the shower” may not impress Kenan, but it sure is winning fan hearts who applaud the singer for her honesty.</p><p>Gushing over Kelly’s approach, a fan commented on <a href=#>YouTube</a>: “OMG, Kelly is just so unfiltered I love it. She is the most relatable talk show host out there for me.”</p><p>“Love the girl, honest, you rock girl. Love you even more. Go, Kelly,” another fan echoes.</p><p>A third fan opined that a part of Kelly’s success may stem from her huge relatability with fans, writing: “I love it Kelly has absolutely no filter, it’s funny since moving to New York her country accent seems to be stronger. She always finds a way to make us weirdos feel comfortable!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2Z%2BcLfEpaNmm5yWv6y%2FzqeqZq2em7atwMSrnJ1lmK60qrHNnmScp56bsrS%2FyKilZpyfmsCvwIygnK1lo6O5br%2FTmqmsZZGlvbO71ZqjaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
