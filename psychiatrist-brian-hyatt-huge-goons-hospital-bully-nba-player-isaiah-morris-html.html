So you wake up and find yourself surrounded by prisoners because you asked to leave the unit.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Of Hyatt’s patient visits, Cash said: ‘He did see some patients on occasion and when he did he’d have two techs taller than him standing behind him staring at you while he berated you.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Two ‘techs’ are facing charges over the alleged body slamming incident in March, 2022.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One is Isaiah Morris, 54, who played 25 games for the Detroit Pistons in the NBA in the early 90s.
