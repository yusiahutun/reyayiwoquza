Dana Waterman III, one of the foundation’s trustees, said in a Wednesday release. “We are proud to support more than three dozen nonprofits with this funding.”</p><p><strong>Largest grant for the Putnam</strong></p><p>The foundation’s largest grant this year will go to the Putnam Museum and Science Center in Davenport, a $140,000 commitment to help fund a transformational reimagining of the museum’s facilities and programs. “We have a long history of partnership with the Putnam, and we wanted to be a lead donor in their campaign initiative,” said Waterman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/03/220330-Dana-Waterman-Photo.jpg><p>In the area of social welfare, a $50,000 grant will support the implementation of the Zero Suicide initiative launched by the Quad Cities Behavioral Health Consortium, in partnership with Vera French Community Mental Health Center and the Quad Cities Open Network. Created by the global Education Development Center, Zero Suicide helps improve suicide care in healthcare systems.</p><p>“This is another area we’ve been involved in supporting,” said Waterman, “and we were pleased to have an opportunity to provide funding for this important initiative.”&nbsp;</p><p>Across its grantmaking, the Hubbell-Waterman Foundation funds both larger nonprofits and smaller programs, as well as established institutions and newer organizations. This year, in culture and the arts, it will provide $20,000 for general operating needs at the Quad City Symphony Orchestra, while a $50,000 challenge grant will help the newly opened Deanery School of Music with operational support. In addition, the foundation is providing $80,000 for grants to be made by Quad City Arts through its Arts Dollars program.</p><p>Established as a charitable trust in 1967, the Hubbell-Waterman Foundation’s grantmaking has grown in scale to almost $2 million annually in new and multi-year grants while its focus has sharpened on three areas of need in the Quad Cities. Since its founding, the foundation has awarded more than $35 million in grants.</p><p>In 2018, the foundation initiated a relationship with the Community Foundation for technological and administrative support, while continuing to make all grantmaking decisions among trustees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/01/Quad-Cities-Community-Foundation.jpg><p>“We have been thoughtfully transitioning more administrative services to the Community Foundation to be able to develop the institutional knowledge and memory necessary to support our ongoing programs,” said Waterman. “We need an organizational structure and affiliation that provide us with the continuity, stability, and sustainability that will enable the current trustees and our successors to continue to pursue the work of the foundation in the Quad Cities.”</p><p>“We’re so pleased to partner with the Hubbell-Waterman Foundation,” said Kelly Thompson, vice president of grantmaking and community initiatives at the Community Foundation. “Simply put, we can do more together—and that means philanthropy will continue to thrive and grow in our region.”</p><p>Learn more about this year’s grantees and the next grantmaking cycle on the Hubbell-Waterman Foundation’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new website.</a></p><p>The following nonprofits received grants from the Hubbell-Waterman Foundation:</p><p>*&nbsp;
