Kip D. Murray, 45,&nbsp;was ordered to&nbsp;<span style=font-size:13px>serve two years&nbsp;</span><span style=font-size:13px>in custody of&nbsp;</span><span style=font-size:13px>the Mississippi Department Murray of Corrections&nbsp;</span>and three years post-release supervision after pleading guilty to grand larceny and receiving stolen property.</p><p>Murray, who was a&nbsp;truck driver for L&D Scrap & Trucking, took a loaded 18-wheeler from the lot and parked it under a bridge on Highway 84 near the county line, then unloaded the scrap, valued at more than $5,000, into another truck, District Attorney Tony&nbsp;Buckley said. That case was handled by Investigator Sgt. Scott Gable of the Jones County Sheriff’s Department. Murray also admitted to selling 26 “end caps” that were taken from Wade Services and selling them for $2,800 to L&L Scrap in October 2012, Buckley said. That case was handled by Investigator Kim Stewart of the Laurel Police Department.</p><p>Murray was also ordered to pay court costs and fines of $8,565, which includes $7,800 to the victims. He was represented by Meridian attorney Billy Mitts.</p><p>• Clayton W. Rogers, 31, was ordered to spend six years in prison and three years&nbsp;post-release supervision after pleading guilty to burglary of a dwelling, grand larceny and auto burglary. Buckley told the court that Rogers took cigarettes and&nbsp;a tape measure from his neighbor’s Nissan in October 2013, and he broke into another neighbor’s house and stole items in March 2013. Rogers, who&nbsp;<span style=font-size:13px>was represented by court-appointed attorney Brad Thompson, will also have to pay court costs and fines of $4,835, which includes restitution of $2,570 to&nbsp;</span>his victims, Casey Webb and Freddy Blackwood.</p><p>• George Larry Dean Jr., 45, was ordered&nbsp;to spend two years in custody of MDOC and three years post-release supervision after pleading guilty to motor vehicle theft. Dean admitted to stealing a 2007 Hummer from&nbsp;a residence on Pine Street in March 2013, then crashing it into a utility pole as he tried to get away from Laurel police, Buckley said.</p><p>Dean was also ordered to pay $4,100 in court costs and fines, which includes $2,500 in restitution to the vehicle’s owner, Monica Davis, to cover the cost of the damage. Dean was represented by court-appointed attorney Patrick Pacific.</p><p>• Patricia A. Johnson, 48, was ordered to spend a year in prison and two years post-release supervision after pleading guilty to grand larceny. She took rims and other items from&nbsp;L&D scrap and tried&nbsp;<span style=font-size:13px>to sell them at another scrap yard in October 2009, Assistant District Attorney Dennis Bisnette said. She had been on the Pretrial Diversion Program after first pleading guilty&nbsp;</span><span style=font-size:13px>to the crime, but she violated the terms of that agreement and&nbsp;</span><span style=font-size:13px>will face her punishment. Johnson, who was represented by court-appointed attorney Grant Hedgepeth, was also ordered to&nbsp;</span><span style=font-size:13px>pay $1,382.50 in court costs and fines.</span></p><p>• Zachary Brown, 24, was ordered to serve a year in prison, two years post-release supervision and pay $3,545 in court costs, fines and restitution after pleading guilty to grand larceny. He and others stole parts from Springer Auto Salvage to sell for scrap metal in May 2011, but ran into the woods when deputies arrived, Bisnette said. Brown was on the Pretrial Diversion Program, too, but was removed for violating the terms and is facing his punishment now. Brown was represented by Pacific.</p><p>• James E. Landrum, 26, was ordered to serve a year and a day in prison, three years post-release supervision and pay $2,382.50 in court costs and&nbsp;fines after pleading guilty to burglary of a non-dwelling. Bisnette said that Landrum and others broke into a storage shed that belongs to Anthony Murrah and took an impact hammer and other tools. Landrum was represented by Thompson.</p><p>• Trevon Ramsey,&nbsp;33, was ordered to spend a year on house arrest, three years post-release supervision and pay $1,382.50 in court costs and fines after pleading guilty&nbsp;to burglary of an automobile. Ramsey was caught stealing loose change from the car&nbsp;of an employee at Pine Belt Mental Health Services in June 2012. He was represented by court-appointed attorney John Piazza.</p><p>• Carmen R. Dean, 36, was ordered to spend 60 days in prison and two years post-release supervision after pleading guilty to felony shoplifting. Laurel police caught her in June 2013 after she filled a car’s trunk and the backseat area “from floorboard to ceiling” with stolen merchandise from Walmart, Assistant District Attorney Kristen Martin said. Dean was also ordered to pay $2,882.50 in court costs and fines, which includes $1,000 restitution to Walmart. Thompson represented her.</p><p>All of those convicted will also have to participate in the court’s Community Services Program and all of the plea agreements were OK’d by Judge Billy Joe Landrum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwuM6cmKVno6myorjIp55mq5OnrrF5wbJkraCVYsGzwcKko6iZlGK5orrDrGSdqpmrsrN5yKdkqaqZqLyvecWoqWZqXa6yor7SaJirrJmYuaarlG1vcmpmZbBusMNsZ2Ztk5eCbq3AcZtmmZRmgXKDwnBocZ1gY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
