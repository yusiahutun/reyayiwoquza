Food"</strong> host <strong>Adam Richman</strong> is striping down in the July issue of <a href=#><strong>Cosmopolitan U.K.,</strong></a> showing off his new body after losing a 70 pounds.</p><p>In the pic, the 40-year-old TV star flashes a giant smile while lying on his back with only a strategically placed team USA soccer ball covering his private parts.</p><p>"To go from hating the way I looked to being a Cosmo centerfold is a profound honor," Richman told the mag.</p><p>"If you're a guy who's always been the fun-to-be-around teddy bear, then all of a sudden people are viewing you as sexy, it's nice," he added. "It's great not having to be the plucky best friend, or the comic relief anymore—I love that. Who wouldn't rather hear, 'Wow, you look great,' than, 'Ewww…'?"</p><p>Not only did Adam want to flaunt his fit physique, but he also posed in the buff to raise awareness of male cancer for<strong> Cancer Research U.K.</strong></p><p>So, how did the famous food lover get in shape?</p><p>"To combat the monotony of gym workouts, I started playing soccer," he told <a href=#><strong>Men's Health</strong></a>. "I looked at workouts as training sessions. My soccer training includes squats, pushups, resistance-band work, and sprints. Ninety minutes of running became part of my love of the game rather than a chore."</p><p>All that hard work is paying off!</p><p>The July issue of British Cosmopolitan is on newsstands now.</p><p>What do you think of Adam's racy photo spread?
