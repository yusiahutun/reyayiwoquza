Amanda has previously opened up about how special San Diego is for her, as it’s where she was born and where her parents fell in love, and where she and her late mother spent a special day together before she passed away. “It’s my favorite place to ‘just breathe,’ as my mom would always tell me, and to let go of the sadness of not having my mom and remembering how lucky I am that she lived, loved and laughed a lot,” Amanda shared on Instagram in 2017.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Wilmer and Amanda were first spotted together back in April, and although they’ve been spotted out and about on several occasions, they’ve been fairly private about their relationship. Amanda works as a model, and is also a ‘divemaster,’ according to her Instagram page.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Wilmer has famously been in relationships with&nbsp;<strong>Lindsay Lohan, Mandy Moore</strong> and Demi. He dated Demi from 2010-2016, and they’ve remained amicable since their split.
