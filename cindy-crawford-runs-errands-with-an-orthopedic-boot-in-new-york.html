The model didn’t stumble and seemed to be very comfortable while stepping out of her car with a black jacket in her hands.</p><p>We’re not sure what happened for her to end up like this, but we know she does like to go all-out for talented photographers. During a recent Q&A hosted by WWD, Cindy explained why <a href=#>she still likes to model nude in her 50s</a>.</p><p>“I remember some snarky person on Instagram — there seem to be a lot of those — posted something like, ‘Ah, why are you still doing those at your age?’” she said, addressing haters on social media. “And I was like, is there an age where being nude isn’t beautiful? It’s just a different kind of beauty.”</p><p>Day by day, Cindy is slowly showing the world you don’t have to have a certain look to be beautiful. “That is part of the reason I still do shoots,” she explained. However, the Fair Game actress admitted her age has taken a toll on her body. In fact, it’s “a little harder” for her to get ready for the camera.</p><p>“I hope this is politically correct, but sometimes I say I need Viagra for shoots. It’s harder to get it up,” she joked.</p><p>By doing those shoots, the Illinois native is teaching her 18-year-old daughter, <a href=#><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>, a thing or two about the fashion world. Although Kaia is already working as an up-and-coming model, she still learns something new from her mom every day. After all, Cindy is a true pro!</p><p><strong>Scroll down below to see photos of Cindy wearing an orthopedic boot in NYC.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46coKecqWKws63Wn6arnF2nwq%2B%2FjJ6pq5memcBuw8itn2aZnmK8s8DHqKeenJmYeqO7zq1koqZdo7K4edioqaRn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
