The festival took place from April 26 to April 28. Two consecutive weekends of Coachella later, stars including Post Malone, Jelly Roll, Chainsmokers, and Ernest performed at the sold-out festival featuring performances by Eric Church, Miranda Lambert, and Morgan Wallen.&nbsp;</p><p>The annual country music festival also saw Guy Fieri, the celebrity chef, return to provide cookery demos with the stars of Stagecoach. Amid the many changes the Club underwent following Coachella, a major change was the "Mane" stage, which covered the whole north-side field and had four jumbotrons positioned throughout to ensure that everyone could see, even those seated at the back.</p><p>Despite several controversies over the weekend such as Eric Church's contentious acoustic set, and the dismay over Morgan Wallen's festival-closing set not being live streamed by Sunday night, one general conclusion became clear– the communal nature of country music is unrivaled.</p><p>From guest appearances like<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Stagecoach 2024: Best Moments From The Music Festival Ft.
