All four players were interviewed in December, and the case was ultimately referred to the Panel.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China badminton body ‘fully supports’ BWF bans for pair over match-fixing</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were notified via the CBA of their charges of three code violations, including “failed to compete to achieve the best score”, “failed to encourage his partner to play to their best ability”, and “made deliberate errors”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Danish player Hans-Kristian Vittinghus tweeted after the match in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Another absolutely embarrassing all-Chinese match – Li/Liu vs He/Tan. Four players putting in zero effort to make it look like they actually play for it. Embarrassing for our sport once again!” Vittinghus wrote with a photo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“21-15 in 9 minutes … I kid you not. Serves outside of the singles back line. Break between first and second game didn’t even last 45 seconds. Hopeless.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So in the end they did actually play for the win in the final game. Level went from below amateur to normal Chinese high standard. Still not fair (and against the rules), but at least a little positive the result wasn’t fixed.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the hearing, the then- ranked world No 30 in the men’s singles tweeted, “3.5 years later these four have now received suspended 3-month bans for failing to use their best efforts”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coincidentally, Li and Liu were removed alongside the legendary singles player Lin Dan from the BWF world rankings, while He and Tan ranked 17th as of March 22.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He, 24, and Tan, 23, are the 2021 world championships silver-medallists.
