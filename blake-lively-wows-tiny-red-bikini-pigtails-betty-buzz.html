The website for Betty Buzz states the same, saying: "Blake Lively founded Betty Buzz with a simple idea – that what we drink should be held to the same standards as what we eat.</p><p id=ejCfCjQKMO1 data-wc=32>"Our commitment to making beverages that are unequivocally real, uncomplicated and delicious means we take the time to source high quality ingredients so you can feel as good as each sip tastes."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eUnU5M4KKm data-wc=62>In June, Blake announced an expansion to her Betty Buzz line with a range of gourmet sparkling cocktails dubbed Betty Booze. "BettyBooze at your service. These are recipes I've been making for loved ones for years. But I have 4 kids now. And I'm tired. So here they are. In a can. Enjoy. Responsibly. … Ish," Blake posted on her Instagram Stories.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=elIyCeYT3x data-wc=44>Revealing the flavors, which include Sparkling Tequila with Oak Smoked Lemonade, Sparkling Bourbon with Apple Ginger Sour Cherry, and Sparkling Tequila with Lime Shiso, Blake added: It's really [expletive] delicious. One thing I don't compromise on is flavor. And husband. OK that's two things."&nbsp;</p><p id=e0Wd6HVAEH data-wc=53>She also shared a photo of her presenting the drinks on a silver tray on her grid, alongside the caption: "Drinking isn't my thing. But for [expletive] sake, flavor is. Homemade recipes. Real fruit. Real ingredients. Quality booze. No crap. Also a real time saver. Which is why I really did it.
