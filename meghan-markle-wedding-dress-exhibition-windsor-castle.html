Organised by the Royal Collection Trust, A Royal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex features Meghan's bridal gown, designed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a20869846/who-is-clare-waight-keller-meghan-markle/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clare Waight Keller" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Clare Waight Keller</a> for Givenchy, alongside her five metre-long <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/bazaar-brides/a36826/brides-wedding-veil-reason-why/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=veil class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">veil</a> and the diamond and platinum <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/bazaar-brides/a20754258/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-wore-a-tiara-that-belonged-to-queen-mary/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=tiara class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">tiara</a> gifted to the bride by the Queen. An identical version of Harry's Household Cavalry frockcoat uniform made by Savile Row tailors, Dege & Skinner, is also included in the special exhibition, which will be open until 6 January 2019 before it moves to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh next summer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The specific location of the exhibit is particularly fitting. The display is open for public viewing in the castle's Grand Reception Room, where the Queen hosted an afternoon reception for the 600 wedding guests following the St George's Chapel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/bazaar-brides/g20744270/royal-wedding-2018-meghan-harry-pictures/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wedding ceremony" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wedding ceremony</a> on 19 May. This gives visitors a chance to view the bride and groom's outfits up close in the space where the event actually took place. The display also highlights the level of detail and craftsmanship that went into creating one of the most talked-about wedding dresses in recent history.</p><img alt="Meghan Markle wedding dress" title="Meghan Markle wedding dress" width=7360 height=4912 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rc-weddingdress-windsor-241018-10-1540488643.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Royal Collection Trust / Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2018</span><p>Curator Caroline de Guitaut makes final adjustments</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As the dress is so deceptively simple, I thought it was really valuable for visitors to get that little bit of insight into what it really takes to make wonderful couture and everything that is involved," Caroline de Guitaut, senior curator at the Royal Collection Trust, told Harper's Bazaar UK. "From the word go, when I presented idea to them in January, the duke and duchess were very keen on the exhibition. They could see the value in sharing these pieces, their experience and their memories, much in the same way they wanted to share their wedding day."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/4a981a9d-21e6-407f-837e-614c051ca095/thumb_1920x1080_00001_1535536002_38398.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both the duchess and Waight Keller were "very involved" in the production of the exhibit, which has played a big part in bringing it to life. Much to the delight of visitors, the royal couple and the designer can be heard in a recording as part of the multimedia guide, which features Meghan sharing the sweet moment she rushed back to Prince Harry to tell him she knew Waight Keller was "perfect" for the job.</p><img alt="Prince George and Princess Charlotte's outfits" title="Prince George and Princess Charlotte's outfits" width=7360 height=4912 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rc-weddingdress-windsor-241018-18-1540489737.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Royal Collection Trust / Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2018</span><p>Prince George and Princess Charlotte’s outfits are included in the display</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The page boy and bridesmaid outfits of Prince George and Princess Charlotte are also displayed alongside the bride and groom's bespoke mannequins, but there's no doubt that Meghan's dress is the star of the show. Before laying eyes on the finished garment, visitors are also shown just how much work went into its creation. This is highlighted through sketches from the design process of both the gown and the "highly complex piece of embroidery" involved in the veil, crafted by Maison Lesage in Paris.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think that the duchess and Clare had a very clear view on what they were trying to create," de Guitaut explained. "The duchess wanted something that was very timeless and very classic but with a modern feel and this is really reflected in Clare's work for the house of Givenchy. It was a perfect combination in many ways."</p><img alt="Prince Harry Marries Ms. Meghan Markle - Windsor Castle" title="Prince Harry Marries Ms. Meghan Markle - Windsor Castle" width=3500 height=2208 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-the-duchess-of-sussex-leave-news-photo-960080372-1540488903.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WPA Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The newlyweds leaving St George’s Chapel</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The elegant, floor-length gown was made with a double-bonded silk cady to give "luminosity" and a triple silk organza under skirt, along with the most standout feature - a bateau neckline. But with such a simple design - it was made using only six seams - "attention to detail was so important", de Guitaut added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Having started with initial very rough sketches of shapes and rough ideas, Clare then moved on to creating a toille - in fact there were about six or seven of these," the curator revealed. "The first stage was really to establish the proportion, how the fabric would fall and getting an idea of the shape and cut.... and when we look at the final design, what makes the dress so successful is this attention to proportion. It's almost architectural in its construction."</p><img alt="Wedding dress" title="Wedding dress" width=768 height=756 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-wedding-dress-1535470515.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Royal Collection Trust</span><p>The display shows the simplicity of the dress design</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, the final bridal ensemble wouldn't have been complete without the veil. Together, the two pieces were the result of 3,900 hours of work, with a team of 50 people working on the pieces over several months. In a tribute to the Duke of Sussex's role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, the veil was embroidered on one layer of silk with the flora of the 53 countries of the Commonwealth, along with two of Meghan's favourite flowers - wintersweet and the California poppy. But it wasn't always planned this way.</p><img alt="Meghan Markle wedding dress" title="Meghan Markle wedding dress" width=7169 height=4558 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rc-weddingdress-windsor-241018-14-1540488826.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Royal Collection Trust / Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2018</span><p>The display shows off Meghan’s five-metre veil</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The veil was the obvious choice to reference Harry's role in Commonwealth in some way," de Guitaut said. "So Clare began looking at the idea of flags - then I think she realised this probably wouldn't work. She and the duchess then started looking at flowers, but instead of using national emblems, they looked to wildflowers of the different Commonwealth countries. After about a month of researching, the initial sketches show how the flowers would be sprinkled across the edge of the veil."</p><img alt="Meghan wedding veil" title="Meghan wedding veil" width=768 height=576 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/veil-1535470197.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Royal Collection Trust</span><p>The flower detailing on the veil</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like the display of the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress at Buckingham Palace in 2011, it's worth noting that this will be a temporary instalment at both Windsor and Holyroodhouse. "The outfits will remain the private property of their owners and they will be returned to them once the exhibition has closed," said de Guitaut, who added that the garments will be "rolled with specialist materials" in order to preserve them over the years to come.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for Harry and Meghan's verdict? "They haven't seen the exhibition yet because they're on tour," de Guitaut noted. "We are trying to find a convenient time - they're kind of busy! "I hope that they'll be pleased with it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A Royal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex is part of a visit to Windsor Castle from 26 October 2018 to 6 January 2019 and part of a visit to the Palace of Holyroodhouse from 14 June to 6 October 2019.
