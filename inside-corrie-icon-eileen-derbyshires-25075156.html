thrilled when she popped up in an episode of the ITV soap in 2019.</p><p>Emily appeared as her close pal Ken Barlow (William Roache) celebrated his 80th birthday in the Rovers Return surrounded by his friends and family.</p><p>She wasn't there to celebrate with him in person but had recorded a video message for her old friend.</p><p>At the time, soap insiders said Corrie bosses were keen to get the actress back on the cobbles.</p><p>A source told The Sun: "Talks are always on-going between Eileen and Coronation Street bosses, nothing has been confirmed yet but the conversation is always open."</p><h3>Being a godparent and grandmother</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25062357.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Harriet-Bibby.jpg><p>Eileen is godparent to a few of her co-stars' children, showing the close bond the soap stars during their time together on the soap.</p><p>Three of William's children count her as their godmum, as does Barbara Knox's daughter Maxine.</p><p>The star is also a grandmother, as her son Oliver Holt now, who is a notable sports journalist for The Mail on Sunday, has three children of his own.</p><h3>Eileen is known to be a private person</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The star isn't seen out and about very much and does not give many interviews, even at the height of her fame on the programme.</p><p>It's also rare to see her walking the red carpet at awards shows and premieres as she seems to prefer life away from the limelight.</p><p>Her son Oliver has previously said it is not that his mum is reclusive, just that she is a "private" person.</p><p>He has also been quoted as saying that Eileen is "one of the last of a dying breed of old-fashioned actresses who do it for the love of acting, not for all the attendant publicity".</p><h3>Loss of her husband of 56 years</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25148234.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Coronation-Street.jpg><p>The actress's husband Thomas W Holt died this year after a long battle with Alzheimer's.</p><p>Eileen had been with the retired engineer since they met in 1964, and the couple lived in a cottage in Cheshire.</p><p>Their son Oliver announced his father's death as he wrote about their shared love of football in his column for the Mail Online.</p><p>He recalled how his dad took him to his first ever game at Stockport County's Edgeley Park.</p><p>"My dad never forgot Stockport even when he was deep into his struggle with Alzheimer's Disease," he wrote.</p><p>"He wanted to go back there and revisit all the places of his youth. Sometimes, he asked me if I'd give him the bus fare for the journey."</p><h3>Corrie viewers still miss Emily</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25148241.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Coronation-Street.jpg><p>Corrie viewers still regularly mention Emily on social media and ponder what she might be up to in Peru.</p><p>There was disappointment all around when Norris Cole's funeral aired and she didn't show up.</p><p>"Norris Cole's funeral and no Emily Bishop," tweeted one person, alongside an emoji of a broken heart.</p><p>"Would have been nice if we could of got either a video call or one off appearance from Emily Bishop in this storyline about Norris death but it's not to be," said another.</p><p>"I so miss the gentle days when Emily Bishop would pour Norris a cup of tea in her parlour and chat about local gossip," said another.</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </i></b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25072523><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Corrie's Shelley King says Yasmeen's harrowing domestic abuse plot saved lives" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25072523><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25075193.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Coronation-Street.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25072537.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Coronation-Streets-Yasmeen-Nazir-left-horrified-as-evil-Geoff-Metcalfe-returns.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25072523>Corrie's Shelley King says Yasmeen's harrowing domestic abuse plot saved lives</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25067827><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Coronation Street fans in tears as Rita pays tribute to Norris in emotional scenes" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25067827><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25075194.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_TV-Programmes-Coronation-Street.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25067838.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_EHP_CHP_240921Coronation_Street__58183JPG.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25067827>Coronation Street fans in tears as Rita pays tribute to Norris in emotional scenes</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLavv8idnGabn6e%2FqrGMopqopl2atq2xxKdknZ2il8a0tMirnKxlYmp9eIGQbm0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
