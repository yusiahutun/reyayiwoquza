The staffer alleges that Schlapp made sexual contact with him as he was driving Schlapp back from an Atlanta bar in October 2022. The staff further alleged that Schlapp “groped” and “fondled” him without his permission.&nbsp;</p><p>The victim dates back the incident to October 19 after Schlapp, chair of the <a href=# rel>American Conservative Union</a> and lead organizer for the influential Conservative Political Action Conference, bought the staffer drinks from two different bars. At the time, Schlapp had traveled to Georgia for a Walker campaign event. The staffer also accuses the <a href=# rel>55-year-old activist</a> of allegedly invading his personal space while they were at the bar. He explained he was aware of the "power dynamic" as Schlapp is one of the most famous figures in national conservative politics. The staffer told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Daily Beast</a>, "It was a public space, and I was thinking that he got the hint. I did not want to embarrass him. But it escalated." The staffer reportedly chose to remain anonymous but insisted that he would reveal his identity if Schlapp denied these claims.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Conservative leader Matt Schlapp condemns removal of Confederate monuments, warns 'Statues of Jesus are next'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Hunt on for LA 'actress' behind Elon Musk sex allegations as Internet channels its inner Pinkerton</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Matt Schlapp's wife?</h2><p>Matt Schlapp is married to Mercedes Schlapp who is an American communications specialist and political commentator for both English and Spanish media. The two tied the knot in 2002 and have remained married since then. Mercedes has served in two presidential administrations. First, as director of specialty media under George W Bush, and second, as White House Director of Strategic Communications in the Trump administration from September 2017 to July 2019. The two share five children - Lucia Schlapp, Caterina Schlapp, Ava Schlapp, Elissa Schlapp, and Viana Schlapp.</p><p>Schlapp's attorney Charlie Spies reportedly called these claims an "attack" and told the outlet, "This appears to be now the twelfth Daily Beast piece with personal attacks on Matt Schlapp and his family. The attack is false and Mr Schlapp denies any improper behavior. We are evaluating legal options for response." The staffer, in his thirties, reportedly recalls that Schlapp reached over and “fondled” his crotch as he drove him back to the hotel. He sat in shock and called the experience “scarring” and “humiliating.” According to the caller records confirmed by the outlet, Schlapp allegedly called the staff moments after the incident asking if he would chauffeur him to an event in Macon the next day. The staffer also reportedly recorded a series of videos where he can be seen breaking down.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKaYraxdqLCpuMCpp6xlp56zpnnHnqmsm5iauW7DwKWinqpdqMGissWeqWaZk5jCtLHSZpicrJmrtrTAjKidZq2eqLyttcKiq56cXaiyucHApWScp56prqTA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
