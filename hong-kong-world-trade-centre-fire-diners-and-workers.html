Some later chose to walk all the way down to the ground floor via staircases instead of waiting for instructions from the firefighters. The ones who chose to remain were asked to take lifts down shortly after 3pm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At least 13 people, aged between 25 and 60, were injured. Ten suffered from smoke inhalation, including a 60-year-old woman sent to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai, where she was listed in critical condition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fire department senior divisional officer Ng Yau-sheung said all shops located between the first and fifth floors had been vacated due to the renovation and the fire service installations were switched off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/15/63e8cdbe-f787-4f15-8717-87ff751cdfbc_c9e4fdfd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Only restaurants between the sixth and 13th floors, as well as offices between the 14th and 38th floors, were still operating. Fire service installations on those floors were functioning normally, according to Ng.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked whether the fire protection measures should have been turned off, Ng said the department had been informed about the move and would follow up to ensure the building was safe before allowing it to reopen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We will follow up and evaluate whether extra fire service installation is needed,” he said. “We will request the contractor to enhance the installation if needed.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A female manager of a 12th-floor restaurant, which was busy serving 80 people when news of the fire emerged, said staff noticed smoke coming from the stairwell at around 12.45pm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We called the management hotline multiple times but there was no response,” said the woman who only gave her surname, Gu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We quickly gathered the customers and grabbed some towels and evacuated [to the ground floor]. We had to bend low as the smoke was swelling up in the staircase.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/15/cc29fca4-b38b-4568-bbbf-9c7e1e82c6bf_d4b23087.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Renovation worker James Ng, who was based on the third floor, which was blocked off to the public, said only two exits were available due to the renovation, rather than the usual four.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The number of lifts servicing the restaurant floors had also been reduced from four to two, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All the shops on the third floor are boarded up, some escalators only run in one direction while others are not functioning,” he said. “It’s like a maze inside. You will get lost if you’re not familiar with the place.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Office worker Ernest Chan was among the hundreds who had fled to the roof. He managed to make his way back down using the staircase after a long wait.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong drug treatment centre asks for housing help after fire</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Initially we were walking down but at around the 17th floor we heard that there was heavy smoke, so we decided to head to the roof instead,” the 28-year-old said.<br>When visibility improved, he joined others in trying again and they managed to get out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lucas Lam, 25, who works in the building, described escaping with a group of colleagues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As we work on the 32nd floor, at first we remained on [the roof] to stay away from the heavy smoke,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were told to stay put for up to two hours so the air could clear, but he and several others felt they could not wait that long and managed to locate stairs that offered a way out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/15/18648a34-a4ff-4344-bf38-7a9f2daaf770_d27d07cd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Firefighters gave permission for the people remaining on the roof to take the lifts down shortly after 3pm. Among them was Kelly Chow, who works with a tour company on the 22nd level.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People were rushing up the staircase towards the roof. When some attempted to open the door to a stairway on the 30th floor, more smoke rushed in,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After two hours, we were instructed to go down to the 38th floor and take the elevator down in groups of 14. One or two people needed oxygen masks.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the fire department, extinguishing the blaze was made difficult by the large area involved – a space measuring about 100 metres by 30 metres (330 feet by 100 feet).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When firefighters arrived at the scene, the smoke was very heavy,” Ng said. “One of the biggest difficulties that we encountered is that the floor area of the building was large and we had received multiple calls for assistance.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fire was largely out by 4.30pm, and officers were investigating the cause, he added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Firefighters rush to tackle yacht blaze in Hong Kong typhoon shelter</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to information on the website of the Fire Services Department, buildings taller than 25 storeys but not exceeding 40 can count the main roof as a refuge floor – a protected area for occupants to gather temporarily and rest in the event of a blaze.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such a floor should have adequate cross-ventilation and be equipped with fire service installation and equipment as officially required.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Owner Sun Hung Kai Properties said its service centre immediately assisted the fire department and police officers in helping evacuate shopkeepers and customers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The developer said it would fully cooperate with authorities in the investigation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it did not respond to queries about whether the building’s sprinklers were working or whether they met the fire department’s requirements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Christy Leung</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZa7pXnCq6CmnV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGthaoZ5g49on6iml2K4sLrGZq6oqpyZerW%2BwJ2cZpuVo8GzsYyfoKudXZm2r7HRrGSappRixLC%2Byp6prA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
