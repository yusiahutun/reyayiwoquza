Some suggested she was ruining the game, while others came out to say she was <a href=#>‘the best thing’ to have happened to the NFL</a>. Divided was an understatement. But a fan who ‘ranted’ over <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> attending Eras Tour gigs made a valid point that resonated with the songwriters’ adoring followers.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-should-stop-going-to-eras-tour-concerts>Travis Kelce ‘should stop going to Eras Tour’ concerts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1750854248-1024x683.jpg><p>In a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video last month, we see content creator Farron Barneycastle rant about Travis Kelce attending the <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>. The tight end has been to a number of shows, and distance isn’t a problem.</p><p>He jet-setted down to Argentina to support his girlfriend, and recently <a href=#>flew 9000 miles to Sydney</a> last week to do the same. But Tay-Tay has done the same in return. She rushed back to Las Vegas after her back-to-back shows in Tokyo to make sure she was there for the Super Bowl. She definitely didn’t want to miss that <a href=#>celebratory kiss on the field</a>, and neither did we.</p><p>But there are some fans who are strictly Team Taylor Swift and Team Travis Kelce, so one Eras Tour viewer wanted to make a point.</p><p>She says: “Travis Kelce needs to stop going to Eras Tour performances. I find it so frustrating that I am trying to watch Eras Tour clips and I have to look at Travis Kelce’s face.</p><p>“This isn’t the NFL, it’s the Eras Tour. I don’t know what he’s trying to prove by being there, I guess he wants to see if he can boost his career with her success. But we don’t want to see it.</p><p>“He’s taking the attention away from Taylor.</p><p>“Yesterday I got 87 cents in change, and it p****d me off so bad I threw it out the window.</p><p>“I’m going to put a hole in my brother’s jersey. We need to leave the focus on the <a href=#>music</a> where it’s meant to be.</p><p>“This isn’t football, what do you think? The fifth row is the fifth yard line? No it’s not. It’s about the music.</p><p>“If I have to hear the name Travis Kelce one more time, I’m just going to freak out”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-but-her-rant-was-just-to-make-a-point-a-valid-one>But her rant was just to make a point – a valid one</h2><p>But the end of the video is the sweet spot.</p><p>It was a ruse. It was fake. The rant was all made up.</p><p>The Taylor fan wasn’t upset over Travis Kelce being in Eras Tour clips. She used the point to exagerrate how the Lover songwriter was treated in the lead up of the NFL. Some football fans would complain when cameras panned to her more than the field. But that’s not up to the <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><p>The TikTok video concludes: “See what I said sounded stupid? See how I everything I said sounded like a p****d off kindergartener wrote it?</p><p>“Travis was at Taylor’s show many times, and we don’t care. We don’t give a s***, in fact we were happy. We were thrilled, we watched two people have a love story and we’re not bitter”.</p><p>Mic drop.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eCcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02admqZdmLyuvMuaoKerXZavsMHTZqurmaaewG63xKWanmWSmravs4yaq2asmJp6pr7ArGStp6WnerW7jKmpqK6VYq5uvM6ipa1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
