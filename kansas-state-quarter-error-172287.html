Kids and adults filled maps of the country with each new state they came across in their spare change. Some believed they were investing in their future for a time when the coins would <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">rack in some big bucks</a> as collector’s items.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, a full collection of all 50 state quarters is currently only valued at about $12.50 — the combined amount of each 25-cent piece. However, that doesn’t mean they might not be worth something with a little more time behind them. Perhaps your grandkids or great-grandkids will be able to rake in the payoff for your complete set. In the meantime, there are a few things you can look for that can earn you more than 25 cents for your quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>During the minting process of coins, mistakes can happen. In the case of some 2005 Kansas quarters, built-up gunk and grease in the diecast caused the “T” in the word “trust” to appear erased. That’s right, instead of reading, “In God We Trust,” the coins produced on this faulty mechanism instead read, “In God We Rust.” Yikes! Experts at the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Muncie, Indiana, Coin and Stamp Club</a> admit that this error is indeed a rarity, but are also quick to fact-check any claims that those coins are also worth about $100 each.</p><p>That’s not to say quarters with this typo are worthless, though. A quick scroll through <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">eBay listings</a> shows these coins going for $25, $50, and up to $75 a pop. That’s definitely still more than you would have gotten out of the coin just using it to pay a parking meter or vending machine. It’s just another reason why you should take the time to take a second look at the coins jangling around in your pocket or purse.&nbsp;</p><p>It just goes to show that you shouldn’t always take everything at its initial face value.</p><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">WomansWorld.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJopKimla58rK3NrJisZaOprrWxjKqsmqqkmr9usdGrpqtlYWx%2Fc4SW</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
