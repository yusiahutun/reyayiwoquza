"They don’t sit with us in first class. They haven’t worked anywhere near hard enough to afford that. At that age, at that size, you’re telling me they need to sit in first class? No, they do not. We’re really strict on that," he said.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Don't pressurise them at school</h2><p id=e6Kf-Ua7GhvcX data-wc=33>Both Tana and Gordon don't push their children to get high grades in all subjects during their school exams and recognise that everyone has different strengths – in Gordon's case, that was cooking.&nbsp;</p><p id=em71kLqLEQ8lR data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Tana Ramsay discusses twins Holly and Jack's 'nerve-wracking' premature birth" class=hm-link href=#>Tana Ramsay discusses twins Holly and Jack's 'nerve-wracking' premature birth</a></strong></p><p id=exPbaBE_AI9XR data-wc=50>During a speech to young chefs in New York, Gordon said: "I disagree with everybody being judged on one exam.

Baking is chemistry, so forget physics at school."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Eat healthily</h2><p id=eU81EEz641FbP data-wc=22>Unsurprisingly, food tends to be healthy inside Gordon and Tana's home, but they do get treats occasionally, according to their daughter Tilly.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1I-wiZD8Mbte data-wc=1><strong>SEE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Gordon and Tana Ramsay's three homes are every family's dream - see inside" class=hm-link href=#>Gordon and Tana Ramsay's three homes are every family's dream - see inside</a></strong></p><p id=eMXelOOt3FWrd data-wc=29>"Mum tries to keep us all healthy, but on a Friday night, we are allowed some crisps and dips after school, before dinner.

I don't want the staff thinking, it's Ramsay's kid, we can't tell them off. You want to work in this business? You go off to another chef, learn something different and come back with something new to improve the business."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Limit screen time</h2><p id=eTpUbECSYvXp0 data-wc=32>Like most parents, the celebrity couple are very aware of how much time their five kids spend online.
