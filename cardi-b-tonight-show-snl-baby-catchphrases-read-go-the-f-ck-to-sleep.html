<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>Cardi B Takes Over 'Tonight Show': 5 Funniest Moments</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>After dropping her debut album on Friday, and revealing her pregnancy on <strong><a href=#>"Saturday Night Live"</a></strong> over the weekend, <strong><a href=#>Cardi B</a></strong> dropped by "The Tonight Show" on Monday for a co-hosting gig alongside <strong><a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a></strong>. Talk about a busy few days!</p><p>Cardi was her usual freewheeling and unpredictable self, but at the same time she looked a little overwhelmed and confused a lot of the time. She didn't seem to know what was expected of her throughout the night, and clearly had no idea how to play the "Box of Lies" game. We're not sure if they didn't give her a rundown of the show, or skipped a dress rehearsal, but for the first-ever "Tonight Show" co-host, she was basically following Jimmy's lead rather than truly sharing the job of host.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cf692617-4128-543e-b97e-ef3e64e56f74 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5c53ef0b-075a-50d3-878a-9a88327b9f89 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d7/5by4/2018/04/09/d757c30fa48f5de089d43c5c477ba2e7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Cardi B Got Painful Butt Injections, Is in a Gang and 4 More Things We Learned From GQ Interview</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Maybe it was just exhaustion and the afterglow of that big "SNL" reveal, though, which was beautifully handled during her second performance. "I never really wanted to reveal that I had a baby; I just wanted to hide it to the end," Cardi admitted to Fallon. "I could have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those meddling paparazzi!</p><p>"I was just scared of what people would think and say. I was just freaking out. But I just couldn't-- I was like, well, why not? Why not present it in a beautiful, clean way. And then 'Saturday Night Live,' it was just, why not?"</p><p>And why not co-host "The Tonight Show" as her star just continues to rise? Below are the highlights, and all of her sound effects.</p><h2 class=h2>MONOLOGUE</h2><p>"I'm making history tonight," Cardi B told the "Tonight Show" audience. "My album just dropped, but I'm the first late-night co-host that isn't a white guy. What's up?"</p><p>After a momentary pause, Jimmy Fallon had to agree she was right. "I'm so excited to see you that I might go into labor," he told her. He then told the audience, "Backstage, Cardi was doing some breathing exercises and it sounded like the bird section of a PetSmart."</p><p>They then shared a quick segment where they took turns taking jabs at a picture of President Trump in a tight jacket. "It looks like me when I was trying to hide my baby bump," Cardi said, followed by, "It looks like they put his butt implants on the wrong side."</p><p>Finally, they made their way to the desk, which Cardi promptly sat behind in Jimmy's chair. "'Cause you know, I just thought I was going to be like special host, oh special chair!" she explained as he looked around for a place to sit. Finally, he had to settle for a tiny stool next to her.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:295a628a-ec31-528e-ba27-bcecc9ce4e28 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5c53ef0b-075a-50d3-878a-9a88327b9f89 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a9/5by4/2018/04/03/a9c09d9f45435f27a9a73aa3edcca0e4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Cardi B Struts Her Stuff in Lingerie and Makes Out With Offset in 'Bartier Cardi' Music Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>CATCHPHRASES</h2><p>Since she was going to be alongside him for the entire hour, Jimmy Fallon figured he and the audience should get a better understanding of some of the unique sounds Cardi B uses to communicate, and she graciously agreed to help translate, and even how to best pronounce them.</p><p><strong>Eeeeooowwww!</strong> "You know, that's like almost a sad cat sound. Like a cat that's going through pain," Cardi explained. As for when it would be used, she said, "When they tell you a good news but it's good, but it's not exciting, like, 'Oh I have a new job, Eeeooowwww."</p><p><strong>Eeeeooowwww! (but higher)</strong> "It's like, 'Oh my God, I'm hosting the Jimmy Fallon Show, Eeeooowwww!"</p><p><strong>Okuuuuuuurt!</strong> "It's like a cold pigeon in New York City," Cardi described her most famous affectation. "If somebody checks somebody it's like, 'Okuuuuuuurt, I didn't know she had all that in her!'"</p><h2 class=h2>BOX OF LIES</h2><p>Now that we were all on the same page with language, it was time for Jimmy Fallon and Cardi B to play "Box of Lies" together. In this game, they must describe weird objects they're looking at and try to get the other to guess what it is.</p><p>Cardi went first, and had two fluffy balls jolting around in a pen. "It's fluffy," she told Fallon, "Or is it?" When he asked her, "What is in your box?" she looked earnestly at him and said, "Not a penis."</p><p>Maybe ... and go with us here ... just maybe Jimmy should have gone first to give her a better understanding of how the game works. She wasn't sure what she was supposed to be telling him, so she went with "pussy balls."</p><p>Close enough?</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:89ba1bb3-27f4-5b87-9594-9dd5119aeb54 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5c53ef0b-075a-50d3-878a-9a88327b9f89 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f6/5by4/2018/04/08/f6074477838454f181b9b3a4f78497a6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chadwick Boseman 'SNL' Sketches Ranked: Bad Night for Black Panther as Cardi B's Pregnancy Steals the Show</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>I'M GONNA BE A MOM</h2><p>Jimmy Fallon helped prep Cardi B for her upcoming motherhood by offering her a couple of children's books he had written, but what he really wanted was to have her read a few vulgar lines from "Go the F*ck to Sleep."</p><p>But while that was cute, it wasn't nearly as cute as Cardi's genuine moment of realization that all of this was happening for her, and it was coming soon. As Jimmy dimmed the lights and cued up some reading music, Cardi softly said, "Okay I'm getting nervous now. I'm getting close to the date. Oh man, I'm gonna be a mom. Okay."</p><p>She then settled in to read, but already our hearts had melted.</p><p>At another point in the show, Jimmy invited an audience member down to have his custom voicemail message recorded by Cardi, and while the final product was a bit of a mess as far as outgoing messages go, the fan was loving every minute of it.
