"I had become involved with a woman who was my best friend, and, as it happens, a person who is like a godmother to my son."</p><p>His reaction: "Mom, love is love whatever you are."</p><p>Of her girlfriend Clare, she adds, "We had an immediate connection but didn't think of it as romantic or sexual. She was one of the most beautiful, charming, brilliant and funny people I had ever met, but it didn't occur to me that we could perhaps choose to love each other romantically."</p><p>But Maria wasn't the only one with big news.</p><p>British Olympic diver <strong>Tom Daley</strong> also revealed he's bisexual in a new YouTube video -- and talked openly about dating another man.</p><p>"In spring this year, my life changed massively when I met someone and they made me feel so happy, so safe and everything just feels great," the 19-year-old said. "And that someone is a guy. It did take me by surprise a little bit. It was always in the back of my head that something like that could happen, but it wasn't until spring this year that something just clicked."</p><p>"I still fancy girls, but right now I'm dating a guy and I couldn't be happier," he added.</p><p>Watch his whole video below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnR7kGtmaWpfoq6ztcBmmZ6knKR6pLvMnqpmp6WperW7zGabmqSVrnqjtdKer66ZnGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
