There are still some things that don't work across multiple Echos, though, so we're here to rest any confusion.</p><h2 id=your-second-echo-will-already-come-pre-configured>Your Second Echo Will Already Come Pre-Configured</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xIMG_3806.jpg.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.YCpcgIosX-.jpg><p>When you order a second Amazon Echo and activate it with your Amazon account, many of your settings from your first Echo will automatically transfer over to your new Echo device.

Your Echos&nbsp;now have the technology to not only hear your voice and the direction it’s coming from, but also to gauge how far away you are from your various Echos. Using that information, Alexa determines which Echo you’re closest to and uses just that device, shutting off the other Echo units that also heard your voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=timers-and-alarms-don-t-work-over-multiple-echos>Timers and Alarms Don't Work Over Multiple Echos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/xIMG_3807.jpg.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.jYcuGLO9it.jpg><p>Unfortunately, if&nbsp;you tell Alexa to <a href=#>set a timer or alarm</a> on one Echo, it won't sync to all of the other Echo devices in your house.

We still wish there were some things that would sync across Echos, like timers or alarms, but I'm sure Amazon will be broadening its Echo features more and more over the next couple of years---there will likely be much to look forward to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhpb2pma4Fww8eaq2axn6p6pK3NZpinnF2Yrq%2FAjJ2mZq%2BZqbVuudSlq6KonJp6ornAs6anZZWYtbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
