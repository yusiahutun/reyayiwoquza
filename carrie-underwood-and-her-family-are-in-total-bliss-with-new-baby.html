After <a href=#>welcoming their second child,&nbsp;Jacob Bryan Fisher</a>, on January 21,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Mike Fisher</strong></a>&nbsp;“are in total bliss right now,” a source recently dished to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>“The delivery was long, but there were no complications,” the insider said, adding that “the road to having this baby was so difficult emotionally and physically on both Mike and Carrie, so to have Jacob come home happy and healthy really fills them with immeasurable joy.” The 35-year-old country star and her former pro hockey player hubby, 38, have been trying to have baby&nbsp;No. 2 for years after they welcomed their firstborn son, 3-year-old Isaiah, in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/carrie-underwood-baby.jpg><p>And the journey to having a second child got even more complicated when Carrie suffered <a href=#>three miscarriages over the span of two years</a>. So when little Jacob entered the world just a few days ago making the “Love Wins” singer a mom-of-two, she couldn’t have been happier. “Carrie can’t <a href=#>believe&nbsp;how blessed she is</a>.&nbsp;This is a great time for&nbsp;Carrie and her&nbsp;husband, and they’re going to cherish every single moment,” a source close to the couple exclusively revealed to&nbsp;Closer Weekly&nbsp;following Jacob’s arrival.</p><p>Carrie and Mike aren’t the only ones over-the-mom about baby No. 2. The source also added that Isaiah has been dreaming about this day and can’t wait&nbsp;to hang out with his new “partner in crime.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/carrie-underwood-family.jpg><p>“Big brother Isaiah&nbsp;is already itching to play with Jacob.&nbsp;Mike’s been explaining to&nbsp;Isaiah that he needs to wait a few months before they can roughhouse,” the source shared. “It’s no secret that&nbsp;Carrie wanted a girl, but two boys is also a dream come true.&nbsp;Isaiah calls&nbsp;Jacob his little partner in crime, it’s super adorable.”</p><p>Now that they’re officially a family-of-four, what’s next for Carrie and her adorable brood? In just a few months, the blonde-beauty will be heading out for her “Cry Pretty 360” tour — but instead of going solo, Carrie’s bringing along her precious babies. “She’s already planning on her boys traveling with her. Her team has already&nbsp;added a nursery to her tour bus,” the insider revealed. Congrats again on the arrival of baby Jacob, Carrie and Mike!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKuqmZp6trrDnqmwp5%2BZeqK6w2afnqpdm66utcuyZJqqlWK2r3nTqKuapF2Xuaq%2F0mauoqyYYrumw4ybmJuxXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
