If you get them all the time, you might even want to avoid your phone entirely. A good way to counter the problem is to use a reverse phone number lookup tool.</p><p>Below are some of the best free reverse phone lookup services available online. Just enter the number that called you, and they can track down the caller. Their free features vary, but each can give you enough information to decide, for example, whether to ring someone back or report a text as spam.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=cocofinder>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CocoFinder</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cocofinder-reverse-phone-lookup.jpg><p>You'll definitely want to check out CocoFinder and its highly praised free reverse phone lookup feature. To find out or confirm a caller’s identity, type in their digits and let the directory do its job.</p><p>CocoFinder will match the phone number with likely candidates. In the end, you’ll get reports to choose from, containing details on each person. Your question will go from "Who called me from this phone number?" to "What info do I check first?"</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Since the data comes from freely available sources, it’s all legal. How much information you get, however, depends on the caller’s online footprints. Expect as little as a name or as much as social media profiles and acquaintances.</p><h2 id=spokeo>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spokeo</a></h2><p>Another website with a great reputation is Spokeo. A quality algorithm and a wide range of legit sources give the service a great chance of tracking down even the most obscure callers.</p><p>Spokeo’s paid features increase its effectiveness further, but its free insights can include plenty of accurate details like age, address, and relations. As far as phone number lookup free services go, this is one of the best because of its convenience.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Whether or not you choose to invest, you can count on the platform to quickly identify a caller. Above all, it’ll keep you and your loved ones safe from scams and other harmful situations.</p><h2 id=peoplefinders>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PeopleFinders</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/peoplefinders-reverse-phone-lookup-advantages.jpg><p>The answer to “Is there a free reverse phone lookup service?” is complicated. Even though a simple Google search is among the <a href=#>most reliable methods to identify phone numbers</a>, there are limits to what you’ll get for free.</p><p>PeopleFinders, for example, only works in the US and offers its full features to paying customers. On the other hand, you’re dealing with a powerful directory that’s constantly updated with new data from public records.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This means that its free results are as trustworthy as its premium ones. There’s a lot you can get out of the site’s search tool, as well as its mobile app called IdentityWatch for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>. Its multiple functions make PeopleFinders among the best free reverse phone lookup tools to rely on.</p><h2 id=truecaller>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Truecaller</a></h2><p>Being able to track a call immediately from your phone is very handy, so it’s worth exploring services that have accompanying mobile apps. Truecaller is one of these tools, and it should be at the top of your list.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>While you can use Truecaller's desktop site, you do need to register with an email and phone number. However, its free high-end capabilities as a reverse phone lookup service deserve the effort.</p><p>If you decide to use its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> app, a basic license provides real-time caller ID and spam blocking services at no cost. Premium members get more perks, like call recording, contact requests, and no ads.</p><p>Even so, Truecaller’s free tools alone can demonstrate how helpful and smart its technology can be in identifying unwanted callers and keeping them at bay.</p><h2 id=spy-dialer>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spy Dialer</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spy-dialer-reverse-phone-lookup.jpg><p>If you want a simple and straightforward online tool, Spy Dialer is a great choice. The software behind the service can actually call the number you provide and gather information on its owner from social media, public records, and so on.</p><p>Every day, you get completely free reverse phone lookups with the caller's name, address, pictures, and anything else publicly and legally available. You can also delete your own details from Spy Dialer and avoid being investigated yourself. For extra security, look into other <a href=#>ways to check who's tracking you online</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>More in-depth information or unlimited use of the service comes at a cost. While not essential, it’s good to know that you have those options if you need them to lookup calls that are more complicated.</p><h2 id=cellrevealer>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CellRevealer</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cellrevealer-reverse-phone-lookup-service.jpg><p>For a more communal touch, try a website like CellRevealer. According to the service’s existing happy customers, its phone tracking capabilities are basic but very reliable and, of course, free.</p><p>On top of that, the platform works as a notice board, where users post about scammers or telemarketers. So, while checking a number of your own, you can quickly make a note of callers to avoid. Sometimes such simple features are all you need from a caller ID lookup service.</p><h2 id=spytox>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spytox</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spytox-free-reverse-phone-lookup.jpg><p>Among several free and legit reverse phone lookup sites, Spytox stands out.

A free reverse phone lookup with a name alone can give you peace of mind.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=zlookup>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ZLOOKUP</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/zlookup-reverse-phone-number-lookup.jpg><p>ZLOOKUP is a great option for finding phone numbers, as it's dedicated to investigating callers and nothing else.

Its creators also know what a nightmare cold callers can be and offer a handy tool anyone can access.</p><p>Just type in the number you want to track. Then, the directory reaches out to its databases and tries to retrieve a name and any other useful information. From there, you can take the search further by using <a href=#>websites to find people on the internet</a>.</p><h2 id=whitepages>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitepages</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/whitepages-reverse-phone-lookup-tool.jpg><p>The need to identify unknown callers has been around for a long time and so have online directories like Whitepages. Established in 1997, it’s among the oldest services around and people continue to appreciate it.</p><p>It’s not the most impressive platform, but what it lacks in style or special features it makes up for in extensive information. With a huge database at its beck and call, there’s not much you can’t find on Whitepages.</p><p>A single phone number could lead you to the caller’s business details and even criminal records. Once again, though, the amount of information you get for free depends on what’s publicly available. Premium memberships and their extra insights are always an option.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=anywho>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AnyWho</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/anywho-reverse-phone-lookup-tool.jpg><p>A final name to look out for is AnyWho. Its strongest features come at a price, but you can still make good use of its free search tool.</p><p>AnyWho’s value comes down to the fact that it ticks three essential boxes: speed, accuracy, and big resources. These qualities mark the best phone number lookup websites, as they make users feel safe and happy with the results.</p><p>Based on AnyWho’s customer satisfaction, you’re in good hands, even in its most basic form. While still working its way up the popularity ladder, the information you find here will still be helpful.</p><h2 id=look-beyond-reverse-phone-lookup-services>Look Beyond Reverse Phone Lookup Services</h2><p>Any one of these websites can give you a name, at the very least. A few more handy details, and you can work out for yourself whether a caller is someone you know, and if they're safe to contact. Don't hesitate to lookup calls whenever you feel unsure.</p><p>At the same time, keep in mind that it’s not so easy to avoid all scams and hacks.
