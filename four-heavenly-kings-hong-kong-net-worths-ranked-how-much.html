Soon after joining TVB’s artist training programme in 1981, Lau’s lead role in 1982 drama The Emissary earned him his initial popularity. From then on, he went on to star in multiple lead roles in TVB series, which earned him a spot among the “five Tiger Generals of TVB” alongside other famed actors and singers in the television programme All-Star Challenge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite Lau leaving TVB in 1985 because of contract issues, he continued his showbiz career as a singer. Although his initial album wasn’t a big hit, his perseverance allowed him to become one of Cantopop’s most successful artists. His hit album “Would It Be Possible” nabbed him his first Top 10 Gold Song Award from RTHK in 1990. After that, Lau had a streak of winning at least one RTHK award category each year until 2007, and now he holds the Guinness World Records for the most awards won by a Cantopop male artist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/37daf853-2e44-460f-b5d5-55b9a020dd15_e18049fa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alongside his music career, Lau acted in films too. Because of his massive popularity all across Asia from playing Yeung Kuo in The Return of the Condor Heroes, he landed his breakout role in action comedy film On the Wrong Track in 1983. His acting career continued to thrive as he starred in iconic Hong Kong films like the Infernal Affairs series, Running on Karma and many more.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1991, Lau set up his own film production company, Teamwork Motion Pictures, which has pushed out award-winning films like Made in Hong Kong and his most recent action blockbusters, the Shock Wave series. While Hong Kong’s film market initially brought Lau to success, his career continues to flourish as he produces films in Mainland China.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/3b816b2d-f1b2-45ca-b815-11b84f23bb2d_1f65bfc7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since Lau’s career has taken off in China, he has gained a huge online presence on Douyin, getting noticed by younger audiences. He holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest person to reach 10 million followers on Douyin, within 12 hours and 22 minutes.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Which celebrities renounced their Chinese citizenships?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Jacky Cheung Hok-yau, 60</strong><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"><br></strong><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-2 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Net Worth – US$50 million</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/794e6f54-684d-4fb4-be8c-c07f7a11631f_cf7bf82c.jpg>Jacky Cheung has an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">estimated net worth of US$50 million</span></a>. He was originally a reservation officer for Cathay Pacific. During his time there, he won an amateur district-wide singing competition in 1984, which kick-started his career in the entertainment industry.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From 1985 to 1998, he also had a streak of winning a Top 10 Songs award from Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards every year, except in 1988.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung’s musical achievements don’t end there. In 2010, he recorded the Christmas song Everyday is Christmas, which the legendary group Earth, Wind & Fire covered four years later. Ovi.com announced that the track was the tenth most downloaded Christmas song in 2010, joining classic hits like Wham’s Last Christmas and Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/d0310193-b90d-4603-b1e1-84a371f4cec6_0d5985df.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung also holds a Guinness World Record for the largest combined audience for a live act in 12 months, accumulating over 2 million audience members. During his 1/2 Century Tour that spanned over a year, Cheung performed 105 live concerts in 61 cities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Cheung is better known for his singing, he has also been in his fair share of films – like As Tears Go By, The Swordsman and Golden Chicken 2 – and has received numerous awards for his performances. But unlike the other three Heavenly Kings, Cheung is one of the few singer-actors in the Cantopop industry who has never starred in a television drama.</p>Cheung has still been putting out music to this date, even collaborating with other popular Cantopop artists such as Gin Lee on the track When The Sun Rises. During the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, he released The Meaning of Perseverance in conjunction with Hong Kong Cable Television and Hong Kong Open TV as a motivational track for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong’s athletes.</span></a><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Tony Leung’s 80s TV career: before Shang-Chi, he trained with Stephen Chow</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Leon Lai Ming, 54</strong><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"><br></strong><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-2 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Net Worth – US$50 million</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/f81bc115-1791-4e68-849b-aa8798136e42_20cd829d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tied in second place with Jacky Cheung is Leon Lai, who also has a net worth of US$50 million. Initially working as a salesperson for a mobile phone company, Lai competed in the New Talent Singing Awards in 1986 and won second runner-up. After signing a contract with Polygram, his debut album “Leon” went gold and he was met with huge waves of success. Like his Heavenly King counterparts, Lai also consecutively won the Top 10 Songs awards for numerous years at the Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his career, Lai has made some notable achievements, such as being the first Cantonese artist to make a top 10 chart in Korea with his Korean song After Loving You. Lai also became the first singer from Hong Kong to represent the city in the first Asia Song Festival in South Korea back in 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/f905f5cc-74de-470c-80bf-12246d290c00_821f4bc5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After competing in the New Talent Singing Awards, Lai started to appear in a few TV series. However, it was the release of TVB series The Breaking Point in 1991 that propelled his fame not only in Hong Kong but in Taiwan as well. Aside from nominations for his film performances, Lai has won several Best Original Film Song awards, such as for his songs in Eighteen Springs and City of Glass.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apart from being a singer-actor, Lai has been frequently involved in charity work. After his first experience with Unicef for a polio eradication project in China, he was appointed as an International Unicef Goodwill Ambassador – the first Hong Kong citizen to earn the position.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lai was also awarded a Medal of Honour from Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, in 2003 for his philanthropy, in addition to the Silver Bauhinia Star in 2019 for his loyalty to the Hong Kong Government.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/de362874-8fec-4a00-b5a6-a40aba6a6b8b_68d235c1.jpg>Most recently, this July Lai made his return to Hong Kong’s Coliseum after 10 years.

After being fired from a jewellery company at 19 years old, Kwok joined a dancing training course at TVB where his talents were immediately recognised.
