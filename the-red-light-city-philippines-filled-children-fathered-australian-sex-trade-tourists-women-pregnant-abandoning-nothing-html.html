Then the rain comes. The weather is so similar – steamy heat, then rain and evening relief – that it can seem as though time is circular, and the same day recurs. It can seem that life in this Philippine city, north of Manila, is lived on a vast wheel of actions without consequences.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But that would be wrong. Children are conceived and born, and they grow older. Here, in an area called Hadrian's Extension, the laneways are made of compacted rubbish, rubble and dirt. Mid-afternoon the children are playing a game of throwing their thongs, or slippers, as they call them, at an old tin can.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Eleven-year-old John* wants to be a doctor. Kevin, ten, wants to be a pilot. Francine, seven, hopes to be a teacher. Another child, Pedro, lives a little distance away in an actual house on a paved street. He wants to be a lawyer, to help himself and all these other children.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>Scroll down for video &nbsp;</span></span></p><img id=i-a01be0b3ce62ec98 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/17/07/2A9B911900000578-3164917-Francine_7_outside_her_home_Hadrian_3_slum_Francine_s_father_-a-31_1437114589786.jpg height=640 width=962 alt="Francine, 7, outside her home in Hadrians slum.

Some of the fathers paid to support their children, then stopped. Some never paid at all. Some don't even know they have children. Kevin's father was a paedophile in his mid 50s called Peter. He groomed his victim, Kevin's mother Rochelle, from Australia using social media. He visited her for two nights of sex then cancelled his Yahoo email address, the only contact she had for him, when she told him she was pregnant. She was 14 years old.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Hadrian's Extension is named after the nearest thoroughfare that could conceivably be called a road. It is a hidden place. Google Street View has never been down these laneways. There are people who have lived in Angeles City for decades who don't know Hadrian's Extension exists. Yet, even here, there is a hierarchy. The poorest live next to the rubbish dump, where people open the stinking bags in the heat to comb for saleable plastic and metal.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>This is where Kevin lives, in a 9-metre-square shed patched together from scraps of building refuse. He and Rochelle share it with his grandfather and his uncle, who work as labourers in the construction industry and look as though they are made of sinew and leather. The family sleeps on sheets of cardboard and cooks on an outside open fire. There is no running water.</span></p><img id=i-f73fb3983cea24c4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/17/07/2A9B912200000578-3164917-Angelo_7_and_his_mother_Janice_at_her_cousin_s_house_in_Hadrian_-a-21_1437114588453.jpg height=640 width=962 alt="Angelo, 7, and his mother Janice at her cousin's house in Hadrian.

They are comparatively well off, living in a solid house, five people in three rooms. They have a small farm and sell the produce to their neighbours from a tiny shop. There is enough to eat and to pay the bills, but not enough to send John to school.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>John's Melbourne-based father is acknowledged on his birth certificate. He used to visit John, and his Facebook page includes pictures of them playing together. Intermittently, he paid about 5000 pesos (A$145) to Lilia to raise his son.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>That allowed John to attend a private school, the only decent education in Angeles City. Now the money has stopped coming and John's father has blocked the family from contacting him on Facebook. John has been pulled out of school. Until the bill is paid and his school report is released, he won't be able to attend even the dilapidated public school, where kids are packed like sardines, educated in two shifts because there is not enough room, and the teachers have to buy chalk and paper out of their meagre salaries.</span></p><img id=i-fa84412dbf753040 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/17/08/2A9B912C00000578-3164917-Australia_and_the_Philippines_have_a_reciprocal_arrangement_wher-a-7_1437119040663.jpg height=640 width=962 alt="Australia and the Philippines have a reciprocal arrangement whereby a child-support assessment raised under Philippine law can, in theory, be enforced against an Australian resident.

It sits 85 kilometres north-west of Manila. During the Vietnam War it was the home of the Clark Air Base, then the largest American military facility outside the US. The base stayed open until 1991, when an eruption at Mt Pinatubo, the volcano looming 15 kilometres to the west, precipitated its closure. By then, the town of the angels had become one of the centres of Asian sex tourism.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>According to the local department of tourism, more than 4.7 million foreigners come to the Philippines each year. More than 60% of them are men, and Australians are among the most numerous and are the third biggest spenders, behind the Americans and South Koreans and just ahead of the Japanese. The US Department of State report on human trafficking states that Australians are also one of the groups most active in child sex tourism, although in Angeles City, it seems, most of this is not 'preferential' but situational – men who have sex with prostitutes, and simply don't care about their age.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In 2011 the then US ambassador to the Philippines, Harry K Thomas Jr, stated that 40% of male tourists visited the country for sex, and no other reason. His statement was both controversial and impossible to prove. He backed down. But nobody who has been to Angeles City doubts that he was right.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Figures are one thing. The experience of being in Angeles City is another.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The only people who visit here are sex tourists and, in our case, those who report on them – my 55-year-old self and 39-year-old photographer Dave Tacon. The entire town – with a population of about 350,000 – is a brothel, and its support system.</span></p><h3>more videos</h3><a class=js-move-prev href=# id=ext-gen42><span></span></a><ul

Most of them are second-generation city dwellers. Many completed school, but that is no guarantee of anything. Jobs are so rare that even fast-food outlets require their workers to have a degree. A job in a call centre is the best that can be hoped for, but that requires high-level English language skills. Among men the most common occupation is to be a labourer in the construction industry (building hotels for more tourists) or a garbage collector (carrying away the refuse of the only industry of any size – the selling of sex).</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Abortion, like prostitution, is illegal in the Philippines. There is medicine available, for a price, that makes you bleed. Once you are haemorrhaging, the hospitals will take you in, but it is dangerous. There are also traditional midwives who can bring on an abortion, but that isn't safe either. Women have died. Meanwhile, the contraceptive pill is regarded as sinful, and in any case unaffordable.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Some of the women themselves are children of sex tourism. Grace, 35, is the daughter of an American serviceman whom she never met. She was the youngest of six daughters, all of whom had different fathers – most of them American servicemen. Now she is the mother of eight-year-old Pedro, whose Australian father, Max, apparently chose his son's second middle name in honour of a Melbourne Cup winner.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She last saw Max recently when he visited Angeles City. She had a charge made out against him for failure to support his son, and he was jailed temporarily. After that, the child support stopped entirely until a few weeks ago, when he sent her 3000 pesos to pay for Pedro to have some dental work. It was the first money for seven months.</span></p><img id=i-dc1d391884d8479f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/17/08/2A9B913800000578-3164917-Jobs_are_so_rare_that_even_fast_food_outlets_require_their_worke-a-5_1437119040532.jpg height=643 width=962 alt="Jobs are so rare that even fast-food outlets require their workers to have a degree.

The Australian Department of Human Services, asked to spell out the procedure by which this can be done, advises that mothers should lodge their request first with the Philippine solicitor general. Neither the Philippine solicitor general nor the public advocate, who is meant to provide legal aid to the impoverished, responded to numerous attempts to make contact. There is no hint of the correct procedure to claim child support on the Philippine government websites.
