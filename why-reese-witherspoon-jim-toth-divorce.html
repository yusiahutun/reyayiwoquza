A source close to the Big Little Lies actress and<a href=# rel=noopener> former husband</a> told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People,&nbsp;</a>“They really are the best of friends and this is such an amicable decision. They are so committed to co-parenting together. They are invested in their whole family and making this as smooth as possible for everyone.”</p><p>On April 1, 2023,<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> People</a> obtained the divorce documents where the Legally Blonde actress cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their divorce when she filed Saturday in the Circuit Court of Davidson County, Tennesee.</p><p>The couple reportedly has a prenup in place and she asked for joint custody of their son, Tennesee James. Another source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> about their living situation. “They love Tennessee, and this is their focus. The move from Los Angeles to Nashville was a big deal for him. They don’t want the divorce to affect him negatively. They will continue to co-parent amicably. There is no drama.” Another source told the site, “This is such an amicable decision. They are so committed to co-parenting together. They are invested in their whole family and making this as smooth as possible for everyone.”</p><p>Another source concurred with almost the same statement. “There is no drama, no event or reason,” the insider said of the pair to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! Online.</a> “They are just two people who have made this decision with the utmost love and respect and love for their child.”</p><h2>There is no drama</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/reese-witherspoon.png><p>Multiple sources from different sites claimed that Witherspoon and Toth’s marriage problems were evident by the time of the divorce. “Reese is obviously disappointed and upset. She never saw herself getting another divorce,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> on March 27, 2023. “They love Tennessee and this is their focus. They will continue to co-parent amicably. There is no drama.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“After she was set up with Jim, their relationship moved quickly. Reese was thrilled by his attention and excited to marry him,” added the source of the pair. “They are two very different people though. Reese is headstrong and focused. Although very hard-working, Jim is more laid back. It’s been very difficult for Reese to get to this point though. They both concluded this was right for them.”</p><p>Another source told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Us Weekly.</a> “Reese never wanted her marriage to end, but it’s not a secret that this has been brewing for some time.” Other sources recounted different retellings. “They present as very cold and businesslike,” an insider told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Radar Online</a>. “The passion is nonexistent, and they are living very separate lives.” A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six,</a> “There’s no big scandal or drama, just two people who essentially became co-parents and don’t really have any romantic feelings for each other anymore.”</p><p>Witherspoon talked about how she first met Toth at a friend’s house after trying to get out of a situation at a party and breaking up with Jake Gyllenhall for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elle</a>. “It happened out of the blue,” she said at the time. “This really drunk guy was hitting on me, making such an idiot of himself, yelling at me. He was, like, [slurring, scowling, pointing finger in her face] ‘You don’t know me.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, I know. I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know you!’ Jim came over and said, ‘Please excuse my friend. He’s just broken up with someone.’ Jim was a really good friend, pulling him out of that situation. That’s just kind of who he is, a really good person.”</p><p>She recalled how they approached each other and how she didn’t feel like she was going to marry after her nine-year marriage and divorce with Cruel Intentions co-star Ryan Philippe. &nbsp;“Jim said, `I’m gonna show you every day what a good partner is, what a good person is. I’m going to take care of you. I’m gonna do this so much that you’re gonna get&nbsp;<i>used</i>&nbsp;to it.’ I was like, `What are you talking about?’ I’ve never had anybody like that in my life.”</p><h2>Being a single mom</h2><p>The Daisy Jones & The Six producer opened up about being a single mom to daughter <a href=# rel=noopener>Ava Phillippe,</a> 23, and Deacon Phillippe, 19, in&nbsp; Marie Claire in 2011. “You know, somebody close to me once said, ‘Oh, no man will ever accept your children.’ And I just thought it was the most horrifying thing someone has ever said to me in my entire life,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Marie Claire</a>. “I was determined to find somebody who would make that not true. And I got lucky.” She also opened up about her struggles after her divorce. “I was hard on myself when I got divorced. And until I got remarried, I don’t think I realized how stressed I was,” she recalled. “I feel so much relief. I don’t think I recognized how anxious I was about being a single parent. It was really, really stressful. It’s not easy on anybody. I think Nora Ephron says in one of her books, ‘You know, don’t kid yourself, divorce is really hard on your children. It’s really hard. Children will not be better for it.'” Witherspoon reflects on that last statement. “I mean, there are extenuating circumstances. I’m sure everybody’s life is different, so I shouldn’t say that. But it’s really traumatic. Now I feel a great sense of relief and an incredible amount of support from my husband.”</p><p>The couple tied the knot in Ojai, California at Witherspoon’s former home in Ojai, California in March 26, 2011. She celebrated their 10-year anniversary on<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Instagram.</a> “Celebrating 10 years of marriage to my sweet hubby. What a special day with all of our dear friends. Looking back, I can’t believe it has gone so quickly! I guess that’s how it goes with 3 kids, Big LOVE, lots of laughing, non- stop travel, so many dogs, and fun adventures… figuring out this crazy world together. Here’s to many more days in the sun! I ❤️ you, JT.”</p><p>Years before the announcement of Witherspoon and Toth’s separation, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in December 2021 that the actress’ co-parenting dynamic with her former husband Philippe, had “never been better.” The&nbsp;Big Sky&nbsp;alum did not experience “a lot of overlap between his and Jim’s responsibilities” with the kids, the insider revealed, noting that they filled “different roles in [Ava and Deacon’s] lives.”</p><p>The pair have one son together Tennessee James on September 27, 2012. A representative of the confirmed to ET at the time that, “Both mom and baby are healthy and the entire family is thrilled.” She talked about raising a family with Tracee Ellis for<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Interview</a>, “I never expected the kind of relationship that I have with them, but it’s so&nbsp;rewarding to be able to have kids that you can process life with a little bit, and they help me understand the complexities of what it means to be a human now,” she gushed. “So I’m really, really grateful that these little humans are in my life. Adult humans. I have two adult children now, Tracee. It’s crazy.”</p><p>The Legally Blonde&nbsp;made an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram carousel</a> with her husband their 11 year anniversary 363 days before the divorce announcement. “Happy Anniversary JT!! 💗 11 years of adventures, love & laughter. I feel so lucky to share this wonderful life with you. 💕”</p><p><i><span>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
