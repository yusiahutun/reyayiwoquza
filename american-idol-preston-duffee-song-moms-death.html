But it has taken the 21-year-old artist years to be able to sit down and write a song.</p><p>During the latest episode of Season 21 of <a href=#>American Idol</a>, Duffee bravely told viewers that he unexpectedly lost his mother to suicide two years ago.</p><p>“She just struggled with bipolar and depression, and over time it got harder and harder for her to hide it from us,” Duffee explained.</p><p>“That day, we all went to church. We had a cookout after that at the house. All of our friends came. Mom was in a great mood. But as people started trickling out, her mood started to change,” he recalled, sharing the unfortunate story of his mother’s passing. “As I was getting ready for bed, I heard a gunshot. I didn’t know what it was at the time. But then my sister went into her room, and that’s where she found mama.”</p><p>Duffee&nbsp;said&nbsp;his mother's death led the family to become “homeless for three months because we relied on our mom's income for the bills and the house. It was really hard.”</p><p>Through tragedy and the fear of the unknown,&nbsp;the contestant&nbsp;admits the only thing that saved him and allowed him to cope and put food on the table was music.</p><p>And through the pain, he wrote his first song, called “Something&nbsp;to Write About.”</p><p>Duffee performed the tune on his acoustic guitar on the Sunday night (March 5) telecast of American Idol&nbsp;auditons. Standing in front of judges <a href=#>Luke Bryan</a>, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie, he showed off his skills on his instrument while dressed in a camouflage hat and matching shirt.</p><p>And while his vocals and instrumentation shined through, it was his songwriting that seemed to hook the judges the most.</p><p>“Then he told me son all you need to do / Is think of all that I’ve done for you / And how everything that you’ve been through / Has made you into the man you are now,” Duffee sang. “And it dawned on me that he was right / God, I wish that I could see things through your eyes / When I’m looking ‘round / Yeah, maybe all the hard times are something to write about.”</p><p>“Songwriting is a skill, and you nailed that,” Richie applauded. “If you can do 40 more like that, you’ll have a great, great, mailbox career. Just mail in your money, man.”</p><p>“I feel like I’m looking at a young Luke Bryan," Perry added.</p><p>“I’m gonna shoot you straight,” Bryan began. “We’ve got some other country guys in this thing that when you hear them sing, it’s gonna be hard. But what I know from you and the way you thought about that song, that’s the first song you wrote, the way you approached it, the way you wrote it, man, you’ve got a really bright future as a songwriter. Your voice will grow and be stronger.”</p><p>Afterward, all three judges agreed to send Duffy on through to Hollywood.</p><p>“If my&nbsp;mama were still here, she’d be really proud and tell me she knew I’d get here someday,” Duffee said.</p><p>American Idol airs Sundays at&nbsp;8PM ET on ABC.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>14 'American Idol' Singers Who Secretly Hooked Up — Or Did They?</h2>At least two couples who met through <a href=#>American Idol</a> got married, while one more could be headed in that direction. Not all American Idol hookups have a happy ending, however. Here are seven of the most talked about meet-ups, plus the real scoop on how serious things got.<h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Carrie Underwood's Beautiful Post-'American Idol' Home</h2><p>Carrie Underwood invested her money wisely after winning American Idol in 2005. One of her first big purchases was a 3,099-square-foot home in the well-to-do Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tenn. Underwood paid $384,000 for a luxurious 3-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom stone and stucco home in a private gated community.</p><p>The house features a library, a vaulted ceiling and lovely amenities throughout, but while it's very nice, it's certainly not the kind of home you'd picture for a budding country superstar. Underwood wound up being a huge success right out of the gate with her debut album, Some Hearts, and she sold the home in Franklin for $372,500 in 2007, when she purchased the Brentwood mansion that she would later share with her husband, Mike Fisher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmmqWVp7akrc1moJ2nnGK9s7HSraanZZSqs6exxGaqqKaXYrqwudJmm56ZpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
