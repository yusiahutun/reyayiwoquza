The low-impact but high-intensity workout uses slow and controlled movements to sculpt those coveted 'long, lean muscles.' And now, their classes are available on Equinox+, so you can get the perks of the workout method from home. (Because unless you're a Kardashian, chances are you don't have a megaformer — that's the contraption made up of a gliding platform, straps, and springs you see in Pilates studios — in your home gym a.k.a. the corner of your living room.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[solidcore] works your muscles to failure which will result in a slow-twitch shake on our machine, or in your living room with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Equinox+</a>," explains Kayla Raspallo, Senior Master Coach at [solidcore].</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>butt-lifting leggings</a> and jeans seem to be everywhere right now, we asked Raspallo to share a quick butt-toning workout inspired by her Equinox+ [solidcore] class. "The goal of this lower body workout is to get your muscles to failure. That's a fancy way of saying that the muscle is simply unable to perform another repetition," she says. Yes, it sounds scary, but "it's not about how many reps you do but rather how slow each rep is — the slower the better," Raspallo adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it works: </strong>Try this lower-body sequence once through (about 10 minutes) for a quick burn or two times (20 minutes) for an ultimate burn and shake, Raspallo says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>You will need: </strong>A yoga mat or carpet to support your elbows, sliders or towels, and small weights (3-8 lbs) if you want to add to the challenge.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1.

Elongate from the crown of your head all the way past your tucked tailbone and out past the heels of your feet. Knit your rib cage together while pulling your belly button up. Squeeze your glutes!<br><strong>B. </strong>Now that your core is engaged, start to lift your hips bringing your body into a V position, holding for 5-10 seconds.<br><strong>C. </strong>Slowly lower back to plank position.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Try 5 plank to pikes in a row.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This exercise will strengthen and build your glutes by engaging your glute muscles, core, lower back and hips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>A. </strong>Lay on your back with your feet stacked under your knees.<br><strong>B. </strong>Lift and lower your hips, making sure to squeeze your glutes when your hips are high. Remember, slow and controlled!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Repeat for 10 reps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Glute Bridge Variation</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to challenge yourself, you can add in this variation:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While holding your hips high, lift your left leg straight to the ceiling, hold, then lift and lower your hips to activate the supportive right leg (and glute) that's on the floor.

Engage your core and pull your belly button up.<br><strong>B. </strong>With your left leg bent 90-degrees, flex your foot. Think heel to the ceiling as you pull your toes down to your shin.<br><strong>C. </strong>Lift and lower your left leg. Think 2-4 inches up with a 1 inch down. Squeeze your glute when you get to the top part of your range of motion.<br><strong>D. </strong>Challenge yourself by adding a small weight behind the back of your knee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perform 10 reps, then repeat on the other side.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4.

Hinge forward slightly to engage core and protect back.<br><strong>B.</strong> Slowly decelerate back and down by bending from the right knee. The goal here is to get to 90-degrees at the bottom of your lunge to get into your glute.<br><strong>C. </strong>Finish the range of motion by driving down through your left heel and send your head back up slightly on the diagonal, stopping at an 80% bend in your front leg. Repeat each rep as slow and as controlled as possible to get the most burn.<br><strong>D. </strong>Challenge yourself by adding in a 90-degree hold with a set of small pulses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perform 10 reps, then repeat on the other side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>HomeBODIES </strong>is our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>new recurring column</a> bringing you beginner-friendly workouts you can do from the comfort of home.
