It emphasises its original underpinnings as an arbiter of leisure and lifestyle, without so much as a nipple slip.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese Communist Party had long banned pornography, so Playboy focused instead on selling consumer goods.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a departure from the passion-killing streets of Tsuen Wan, it was Hong Kong in the late 1980s who took a punt on the sexier side of things when the first issue of the Chinese-language Playboy magazine virtually sold out its initial print run of 50,000 copies in two days.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its clearly pleased publisher, well known broadcaster, columnist and political pundit, Albert Cheng rather coyly said the first edition sales of August 1986 showed it was “a welcome and very popular addition to the local periodical market”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/09/29/261f37fc-a507-11e7-84b5-dfc1701cb40c_1320x770_192426.jpg>The first cover carried a covered-up Miss Hong Kong-turned actress, Olivia Cheng, who went topless inside and interviews with larger-than-life movie actor Sammo Hung and fashion designer Calvin Klein.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Later editions had renowned 1990s Hong Kong movie actor maggie Cheung on the cover and carried interviews with entertainer-comedian and movie star Eric Tsang and fellow actor Tony Leung Ka-fai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By 1993, Hong Kong’s Playboy infatuation had gone – despite cover models shedding more garments as sales thinned out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It first came to the mainland not through smuggled magazines or videos – though these were certainly circulated among the well-connected – but a 1988 licensing agreement with another Hong Kong company – the Chaifa Group, chaired by the prominent businessman John Chan Chun Tung – saw Playboy’s fashion brand sold to various mainland manufacturers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Throughout the 1990s, Playboy battled, only partially successfully, against any association of its name with the kind of Western “vulgarity” Beijing has long condemned</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Playboy waited until 2010 for its next big China move, the lavish Playboy Club Macau, billed as a VIP experience overlooking the skyline of the gambling enclave.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It would be another throwback to the golden years, this time to the Playboy Club and Casino in Park Lane, London, which opened in 1966 and soaked up so much oil money from Arab whales that the casino’s profits covered the operating losses of all Playboy’s other interests and then some: up to US$80 million a year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hef’s London club lasted 15 years before losing its gaming license; Playboy Club Macau closed quietly after just three unremarkable years in business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomqilnaq7qsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kWpobGxjany4tNhmn66fmGK1prLNnqmsZZakv6LF0maaoaGelnq4sdGeZKuZpJ2ys3nUp2SsnaiueqKyxZqgqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
