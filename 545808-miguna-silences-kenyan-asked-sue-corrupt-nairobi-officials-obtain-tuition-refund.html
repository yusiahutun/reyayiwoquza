I have been given piles of files showing more than a zillion thefts. Just reading the dossier makes my head hurt. Piles of documents proving fraud correspondence between some MCAs and Nairobi County Speaker seeking accountability," reads part of Miguna's post on X.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ebfcc9538332ecd2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Murkomen Denies Forming Team to Probe Chopper Crash: "We Don't Investigate Military Planes"</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: <u>Share your outstanding story with our editors!

You have the power to take legal action with the evidence you possess, and doing so can make a positive difference for Wanjiku and others. The current system is corrupt, and we need individuals like you to fight for justice. Words without action are meaningless," Finteacher said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/82b30f3fe142ae92.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>William Ruto Promises Thorough Probe Into Plane Accident that Killed Francis Ogolla</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In a quick rejoinder, Miguna poked holes into the <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>n's proposal, saying he lacked understanding of legal processes in Kenya.</p><h2>How much does Nairobi owe lawyers?</h2><p class=align-left>Miguna said that he could not sue those implicated in the corruption allegations because the matters were criminal in nature, and only state agencies could institute charges.</p>"These are criminal cases. Only state agencies have the power and mandate to charge him. Some of you should obtain refunds for tuition you paid," Miguna responded.<p class=align-left>Another Kenyan, Joshua Achando, differed from Miguna in his legal position on the matter, saying he could pursue the issue through private prosecution.</p><p class=align-left>According to the Auditor General, <a href=#>Nairobi county</a> <a href=#>owes 11 law firms at least KSh 10.7 billion</a>.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Proofreading by Asher Omondi, current affairs journalist and copy editor at TUKO.co.ke.</i></strong></p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnC8zqWgraGTqHx2gJRxZ3FlnZ60trrAZqqipJWjsKa%2FjKScp7GRo3qiv8qem2arpZp6pLvRq6yprF2jrqq%2BzpugZqeWm7aktcClqmankqmuqrqMrayirJmku26%2BxJ%2Bsp5xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
