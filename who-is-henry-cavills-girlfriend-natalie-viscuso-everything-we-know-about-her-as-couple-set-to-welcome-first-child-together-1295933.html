What more could she want? How about being the most popular girl at school?"</p><p>She is originally&nbsp;from New Mexico and&nbsp;moved to La Jolla, California, with her father and his then-fiancé. She also graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree from the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, where she was also part&nbsp;of extracurricular activities. She is&nbsp;also the vice president at Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment, a Los Angeles-based production company behind Prime Video's&nbsp;Them: Covenant.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>In addition to this,&nbsp;according to Viscuso's now-deleted LinkedIn, her accomplishments included being on the dean's list and being a member of the Sigma Alpha Lambda and Phi Sigma Theta national honor societies. In her personal life, through her Instagram, we know that she is an ardent dog lover and owns one too. Her Instagram is filled with a French bulldog named Meat.&nbsp;</p><br><h2 id=661e34eb2fa5b><strong><strong>Natalie Viscuso is a big supporter of her boyfriend,&nbsp;Henry Cavill</strong></strong></h2><p>Natalie Cavill is known to participate in the annual Durrell Challenge, a 13-kilometer race benefiting the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Jersey Zoo. In 2022, Viscuso joined him to show her support for the cause, but the duo opted to walk rather than run. That's not all; the lovebirds are also on board to work together&nbsp;to bring a&nbsp;Warhammer&nbsp;40,000&nbsp;adaptation to the big screen.</p><p>Viscuso&nbsp;Viscuso also shared a post about the project on&nbsp;Instagram captioned,&nbsp;"Fantasy, horror and sci-fi are the bedrock of my creative language, so when Henry introduced me to Warhammer a couple of years ago, I immediately felt at home." She captioned an image of a&nbsp;Deadline&nbsp;article,&nbsp;"Building a cinematic universe with Henry, our team at Amazon, and the empire that is Games Workshop is an honor and a pleasure."</p><p>She also supports Cavil with his acting projects and ventures and is herself a big fan of them.&nbsp;In June 2023, she joined her beau at the&nbsp;season 3 premiere of&nbsp;The Witcher&nbsp;in London, and then roughly 6 months later, they visited South Korea&nbsp;for the premiere of Cavill's film&nbsp;Argylle. We cannot wait for the couple to begin the next chapter of their lives together, and we wish them the best.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2BstbB5yKxkoZ2ep8Zur8CvoKWko2K0qr7Ln6minZ6Zeq%2Bt05qjop1dq7a0r9Sspmadppq%2FusDHoqWgZaeaeqy6zrBkmpqfqsFutMSrZJqrXZi8trzLnmSsnaRiwbB51p6jnKedmnqntdGsq2abmJ65pXnTqJ6erJiav259kXJscmtj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
