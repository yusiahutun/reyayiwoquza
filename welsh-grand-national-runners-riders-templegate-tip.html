Looks a different horse to the one pulled up in this last year. Won Munster National before taking the red-hot Troytown at Navan. Major player.</p><p>THE BIG BREAKAWAY 4</p><p>Jockey: Brendan Powell</p><p>BIG chance. Has his own ideas but ran a cracker when second in good company at Haydock last time. Stays well and won’t be far away.</p><p>FORTESCUE 3</p><p>Jockey: Hugh Nugent</p><p>ON Cue. Regular winner at lower levels and solid fourth in Becher Chase. Should stay and first-time cheekpieces may help.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>William Hill: Bet £10 Get £30 in free bets</strong> - <strong></strong><a href=#><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30</strong> - <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as cash if it loses</strong> - <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet</strong>: <strong><strong>Bet £10 on Racing and get £30 in free bets</strong></strong> - <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HER</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E</a></strong></p><p><strong>Ladbrokes</strong>: <strong>Bet £5 Get £20</strong> - <a href=#><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>Coral</strong>: <strong>Bet £5 Get £20</strong> - <a href=#><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p>William Hill: 18+.

Begambleaware.org</p><p>QUICK WAVE 4</p><p>Jockey: Charlie Deutsch</p><p>SHE’S Quick. Impressive London National winner 24 days ago. Will stay and likes cut in the ground. Only 4lb higher so big chance.</p><p>PATS FANCY 4</p><p>Jockey: Gavin Sheehan</p><p>PATS magic. Has good record here and fit from spin over hurdles. Trip should suit and looks capable of better. Shortlist.</p><p>TRUCKERS LODGE 3</p><p>Jockey: Freddie Gingell</p><p>KEEP Trucking. Has finished second and third in this and is 9lb lower than last year even before his rider’s claim. Place shout if showing best.</p><p>FANTASTIKAS 2</p><p>Jockey: Sam Twiston-Davies</p><p>NOT a Fan. Is 13lb higher than his last win and well held in the Becher. Has plenty to do here.</p><p>THE GALLOPING BEAR 4</p><p>Jockey: Ben Jones</p><p>BEAR with him. Improving stayer who likes it soft and won the Haydock National Trial before being disqualified for a banned substance. Been laid out for this and should run well.</p><p>TIME TO GET UP 1</p><p>Jockey: Jonjo O'Neill Jr</p><p>TIME up. Third in the Midlands National but has struggled twice since. Down weights but needs his best.</p><p>ASK ME EARLY 4</p><p>Jockey: Sean Bowen</p><p>EARLY riser. Back to form when third at Bangor and this longer trip should be ideal. Fair weight and can go close.</p><p>MUSICAL SLAVE 3</p><p>Jockey: Michael Nolan</p><p>MUSIC in tune. Solid stayer who was second in Bet365 Chase at Sandown. Will be fitter for his comeback and has solid place claims.</p><p>WOULDUBEWELL 1</p><p>Jockey: Tom Bellamy</p><p>WELL up. Decent form in small fields but well held at Haydock latest and needs more.</p><p>CYCLOP 1</p><p>Jockey: Lily Pinchin</p><p>LOP off. Goes well here but in lesser company. Made mistakes when third at Kelso latest.</p><p>WAYFINDER 1</p><p>Jockey: Adam Wedge</p><p>WAY out. Dual winner here before poor run last time. Not certain to see out this trip. Swerve.</p><p>REGINA DRACONES 1</p><p>Jockey: Harry Cobden</p><p>SACK Drac. Did well last season but has looked rusty this year. Should stay but needs more to figure.</p><p>MOVETHECHAINS 3</p><p>Jockey: Jamie Moore</p><p>MOVE it. In cracking form last season in minor company with three good wins around 3m. Capable of better and interesting after a break.</p><p>THE TWO AMIGOS 1</p><p>Jockey: David Pritchard</p><p>TWO hard. Not won for three years but stays well and not disgraced at Haydock last time. This is much tougher.</p><p>GATS AND CO 1</p><p>Jockey: Connor Brace</p><p>NO to Co. Bits of form at lower levels but doesn’t look up to this.</p><p>D’JANGO 1</p><p>Jockey: David Noonan</p><p>D’JAN-Go. Not shown much this season and well short of this level.</p><h2>Templegate's tip</h2><p>THE BIG DOG has plenty of bite in the Coral Welsh Grand National.</p><p>He landed the Munster National before following up with an impressive Troytown victory at Navan.</p><p>Peter Fahey’s hope looks much improved from last year and will enjoy this challenge.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Quirky The Big Breakaway ran well at Haydock and has every chance, while Quick Wave impressed in the London National at Sandown.</p><p>She’s shortlisted along with The Galloping Bear and Ask Me Early.</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
