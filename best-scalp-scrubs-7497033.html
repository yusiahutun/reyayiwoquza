After all, a dollop of shampoo every few days isn’t enough to cut through the layers of product buildup, oil, sweat, and, yes, dead skin cells that pile up on the scalp.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best scalp scrubs, we conducted hours of research evaluating the top-rated scrubs on the market, testing standout options, and consulting with an array of hair experts. After careful consideration, we found 12 scrubs that effectively cleanse and exfoliate the scalp while simultaneously nourishing its microbiome. With any of these picks, your best hair day is just a scrub away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-christophe-robin-purifying-scalp-scrub-with-sea-salt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Christophe Robin Purifying Scalp Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Christophe Robin Purifying Scalp Scrub with Sea Salt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/N82tDrNcKN5tdJk5IoXxJ_Yjoqw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/christophe-robin-purifying-scalp-scrub-with-sea-salt-fa7ec119db1541d5a211eb1ef4e061e0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Blue Mercury</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This gritty but gentle scrub provides a deep cleanse without stripping strands, and lathers into a soft foam as you massage it into roots.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The unique texture takes some time to adapt to, and the scrub can be difficult to remove if it’s not fully emulsified.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a reason this scrub has gained a cult-like following: It’s a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>buildup-busting powerhouse</a>. The award-winning formula features a hybrid approach to exfoliation, utilizing sea salt and dissolvable grains to cleanse, remove impurities, and moisturize the scalp.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the heavy duty exfoliation, the formula is surprisingly gentle. When mixed with water, it transforms into a foamy texture that helps remove product buildup and leaves hair feeling refreshed. Plus, it smells like a summery sea breeze, which makes using this a delightful sensorial experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter your scalp concern — be it dryness and flakes or excessive oil production — the scrub addresses both, and it’s safe to use on color-treated hair. The unique texture definitely takes a few tries to get used to, especially since the formula needs to be fully emulsified in order to rinse away. But, learning curve aside, this scrub is a universal panacea for a clean, rejuvenated scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8.5 oz | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Sea salt crystals, bisabolol, carbohydrate complex | <strong>Scented: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-kristin-ess-instant-exfoliating-scalp-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kristin Ess Instant Exfoliating Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kristin Ess Instant Exfoliating Scalp Scrub" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8mspUreg5Rm-meiDTNbClBkkHYU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kristin-ess-instant-exfoliating-scalp-scrub-95b4c468d0624d348b05aa61c98c79ff.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> As the name suggests, this scrub provides instant results without stripping hair or irritating the scalp.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The thick consistency makes it difficult to fully rinse out, which can leave hair feeling heavy and weighed down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Kristin Ess Instant Exfoliating Scalp Scrub strikes the perfect balance — it effectively sloughs away dead skin and buildup without being too abrasive, thanks to a blend of exfoliating sugars and soothing oils.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many scrubs come in a tub, this one comes in a mess-free tube with a clever pointed tip, which allows for a no-fuss, pinpointed application. We can use the tip to part wet hair, then apply the scrub directly to the scalp, which comes in handy for reaching hard-to-get-to areas that need a deep clean.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This scrub is a bit thicker than other options on our list and requires some extra elbow grease to rinse out, but because the exfoliator efficiently removes flakes and buildup while keeping our scalp balanced and hydrated, we find it well worth the effort — plus, it’s a steal at less than $20.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6.7 oz | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Sugar complex, sunflower seed oil, mango butter, avocado oil | <strong>Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-oribe-serene-scalp-exfoliating-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oribe Serene Scalp Exfoliating Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Oribe Serene Scalp Exfoliating Scrub" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7bZWL3QIA6j-GkQfpkNMvg2fKLM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/oribe-serene-scalp-exfoliating-scrub-bb3bf50317594f729f10beca2a5d13ff.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This purifying scrub features both chemical and physical exfoliants for the ultimate scalp reset.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> At just 4.2 ounces, it’s one of the smallest bottles on the list, despite its luxury price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Oribe’s Serene Scalp Exfoliating Scrub packs a serious punch thanks to its dual-exfoliant formula. An alpha hydroxy acid blend penetrates deep into the scalp to dissolve dead skin and lift away pore-clogging impurities, while soft polymer beads (which are free of microplastics) slough off debris on the scalp’s surface. Though that’s some major exfoliation, hydrating flower extracts prevent irritation and dryness and leave hair feeling clean and nourished.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Between the acids, flower extracts, and polymer beads, the formula is surprisingly creamy and gentle for a scrub, which makes it easy to rinse off unlike others that can leave gritty chunks hidden between strands. We also appreciate the mess-free tube format and the bright citrusy scent.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only gripe is the size — it’s fairly small as far as scalp scrubs go and those with thicker hair will likely go through the bottle quickly.

Plus, it’s formulated without any parabens, dyes, or sulfates, making it a solid choice for all hair types, especially those with sensitive scalps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A little bit of product goes a long way with this scrub, and at an already-great price and a once-weekly suggested use, it leads the pack in terms of value.

It’s a Goldilocks-like conundrum, but we found that storing this in a temperature controlled space — outside the shower —&nbsp;keeps the texture and results consistent.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>11.3 oz | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Sugar, sweet almond oil | <strong>Scented: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-scalps-krastase-energizing-scrub-purifying-scrub-for-oily-scalp></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Scalps</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kérastase Energizing Scrub Purifying Scrub for Oily Scalp</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="K&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;rastase Energizing Scrub " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Z7GBLKRISwnPKuNJ5PaYPzsSPog=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/krastase-energizing-scrub-e00f5376b4d848ff92571676820e309d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Specially formulated for oily scalps, this hard-working scrub not only tackles buildup and oiliness, it also volumizes hair and extends time between washes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This is meant to target oiliness so it exfoliates really well — so much so that it can be a little drying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re no stranger to greasy, stringy hair, and we know how frustrating it can be to need a good hair wash every day or two. That’s why we use Kérastase’s Energizing Scrub — it helps us double our time between washes and effectively sloughs away oil and dead skin without weighing down our strands</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The scrub features not one, not two, but a whopping three different exfoliating ingredients for a deeply purifying treatment. There’s salicylic acid, which helps cut through any surface oil and exfoliates deep within the pores; sea salt, which eliminates impurities and physically exfoliates the scalp’s surface; and vitamin B6, which balances oil production on the scalp. You can really feel the oil-fighting trifecta, working —&nbsp;it produces a cooling, slightly tingly sensation that makes for an invigorating shower experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The results are so good, however, that we’d only recommend using this scrub if your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalp is very oily</a>.

An exfoliating conditioner scrub is definitely novel, and it’s particularly ideal for those with extra-dry scalps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While fruit enzymes and beta hydroxy acids provide dual-action exfoliation, a blend of coconut, jojoba, and kalahari melon oils deeply hydrate the scalp and hair without that dreaded heavy feeling. The fruit enzymes leave behind tiny, micro-sized beads that gently exfoliate the surface, while the BHAs exfoliate deep within the pores. This means that while the scrub might not feel all that, well, scrubby, it’s definitely working. A quick massage and rinse results in an ultra-soothed, clean scalp with moisturized hair that’s soft to the touch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those with particularly curly, coily, or thick hair might have a harder time fully rinsing out those itty bitty beads, but it’s nothing a few extra minutes of scrubbing and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>great scalp massager</a> can’t fix.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5 oz | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Papain, BHAs, coconut oil, jojoba oil, kalahari melon oil | <strong>Scented: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-scalps-ceremonia-papaya-scalp-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Scalps</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ceremonia Papaya Scalp Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ceremonia Papaya Scalp Scrub" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FlDNLbIDg2itgzPlT8KNtDP1KIE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ceremonia-papaya-scalp-scrub-b71a446966d346818018067c075f9186.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Not only does this scrub smell amazing, but the fragrance is hypoallergenic, making it great for sensitive scalps.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The gentle scrub might not be adequate for those seeking a deep exfoliation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ceremonia Papaya Salt Scrub Shampoo provides a gentle detox that even the most sensitive scalps can withstand thanks to its whipped texture that melts into the scalp and mildly exfoliates. Bolivian mountain salt and papaya enzymes carefully break up buildup and dead skin cells, while prickly pear extract provides deep moisture and nourishes hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While all those benefits are great, the non-sensitizing fragrance is what made the scrub a shoe-in on this list. Formulated without any harsh ingredients, the scent is surprisingly gentle and won’t cause any irritation or discomfort. It smells absolutely divine, too: It’s equal parts clean and woody thanks to notes of lemon zest, vetiver, black tea, violet, brown sugar, and tonka beans.

The scrub-shampoo hybrid can even be used daily to keep your scalp squeaky clean and free from buildup. The formula features binchotan charcoal, which draws out impurities that clog the hair follicle, as well as a combination of coconut, peppermint, spearmint, and tea tree oils to soothe and moisturize the scalp.

The dual exfoliation scrub is extremely hard-working — a blend of alpha and beta hydroxy acids rapidly breaks down and dissolves dead skin cells and product buildup, while biodegradable exfoliating beads gently sweep them away. For the best results, allow it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes, just like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair mask</a>.
