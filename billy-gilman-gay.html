On Thursday afternoon, the singer took to YouTube to reveal he's gay.</p><p>During an emotional five-and-a-half-minute long video, the former <a href=#>child country star</a> gave credit to his friend <a href=#>Ty Herndon</a> for making his road a little easier to follow. However, he also revealed that rumors of his sexual preference likely cost him a record deal in recent years, or at least the chance of a record deal.</p>I can honestly say I’m scared to death.<p>“I threw a showcase in Nashville, and no major label showed,” Gilman admits.</p><p>“It’s difficult for me to make this video, not because I’m ashamed of being a gay male artist, or a gay artist or a gay person," he continues, "but it’s pretty silly to know that I’m ashamed of doing this knowing that I’m in a genre and an industry that’s ashamed of me for being me.”</p><p>Herndon, <a href=#>Vince Gill</a> and <a href=#>Keith Urban</a> are three artists he calls out that were always good to him, whether they knew he was gay or not. Several months ago, a reporter took a picture of Gilman and his partner. He says at that moment he knew what he needed to do.</p><p>“It was in that moment that I knew that I’d rather it be from me, than you reading it from somewhere else," he says.</p><p>“I can honestly say I’m scared to death."</p><p>Musically, Gilman looks to be working on a new project. At one point he turns the camera to a television to show a music video he was working on. The video wraps with him thanking fans. "I love you all and from the bottom of my heart, I thank you," he says.</p><p><strong>Country Artists Who Have Come Out as Gay</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6GcocZus8ilpJqmXZyuuns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
