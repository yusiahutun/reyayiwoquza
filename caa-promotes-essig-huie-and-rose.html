All three will specifically focus on day to day administration in these areas. They will report to managing partner, Rob Light, who will continue to head up the music and personal appearances division.</p><p>Prior to joining CAA in 1993, Essig was vice president and owner of Variety Artists International. Essig was recently elected president of the Academy of Country Music. He has many affiliations and memberships on boards in the community, including serving on Belmont University’s Board of Directors and as secretary treasurer for the Nashville Chapter of the National Association of Recording Arts & Sciences Board of Directors. He was also appointed to the Tennessee Film Commission by Governor Phil Bredesen. He has been named the Pollstar Bobby Brooks Agent of the Year (2000), Pollstar Third Coast Agent of the Year (1995-1996, 1998), NATD Talent Director of the Year (1997-1999) and the SRO Agent of the Year (1997.)</p><p>In 1978, Huie began his career in Macon, GA at the Paragon Agency, where he booked tours for acts like the Charlie Daniels Band and the Allman Brothers Band. In 1980, he moved to New York City, where he opened Frontier Booking International (F.B.I.) with Ian Copeland. While at F.B.I., Huie worked to build the careers of the Police, the Go-Go’s and Joan Jett. In 1984, he left F.B.I. and created the H-1 Agency, where he led the Contemporary Christian music industry in crossing over artists such as Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith into mainstream appeal. In 1987, H-1 was purchased by International Creative Management (ICM). Huie moved to Los Angeles, where he ran ICM’s Contemporary Music Division for five years. In 1992, Huie moved to Nashville to assist in opening what was then the only satellite office for CAA outside of Beverly Hills, CA.</p><p>Rose joined CAA in 1982 as a trainee in the mailroom. After two years, he was promoted to agent. Rose has also worked with an array of artists such as KISS, Harry Connick, Jr., Mariah Carey, Shakira, Counting Crows, Bill Maher, John Legend, Tracy Chapman, Steely Dan, and Robin Williams among others. –Bob Grossweiner and Jane Cohen</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGibkZZ6sb7OpqatnaNisrS%2FyKBkoa2ZmnqiusNmqairlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
