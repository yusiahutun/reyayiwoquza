Those dates&nbsp;would come&nbsp;after a high-profile CMT Awards performance and their&nbsp;<a href=#>induction</a> into the Country Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>Sadly, Naomi Judd wouldn't make it to that run â€” Wynonna and Ashley Judd <a href=#>broke news of their mother's death</a> on Saturday, April 30, 2022.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The Judds Best Songs - Top 10 Hits From Wynonna and Naomi Judd</h2><p>The Judds have 14 No. 1 songs and dominated Duo and Group of the Year awards at both the CMA and ACM Awards during the 1980s.
