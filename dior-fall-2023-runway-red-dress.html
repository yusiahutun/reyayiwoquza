Dior collaborated with Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos on an immersive set titled "Valkyrie Miss Dior," an homage to Christian Dior's legendary sister Catherine Dior. It took the form of a bulbous, undulating sculpture made from textile scraps and glittering embellishments that ballooned from the venue's ceiling and over the runway like a glamorous, protective guardian creature. Flower motifs throughout nodded to Catherine's profession as a florist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Staring at it, I thought, "It's going to be hard to take my eyes off that." Then the show started, and I ate my words.</p><img alt="christian dior runway paris fashion week womenswear fall winter 2023 2024" title="Christian Dior : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall Winter 2023-2024" width=4905 height=3268 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/models-walk-the-runway-during-the-christian-dior-womenswear-news-photo-1677609432.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stephane Cardinale - Corbis</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More than 3,600 miles away, I lost my breath for a moment when a red-magenta Dior ball gown appeared amid a collection largely filled with full midi skirts, bar jackets, and button-down shirts in a black-and-white palette. The dress wasn't the saturated cherry of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a42829887/fall-2023-red-fashion-trend/https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a42829887/fall-2023-red-fashion-trend/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fall 2023's dominant color trend" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">fall 2023's dominant color trend</a>. Instead, it was covered in embellishments that glistened like a scraped knee that was only halfway healed. It had the same shape as the tea-length dresses synonymous with Maria Grazia Chiuri's Dior. The ribbon belt cinched in a bow at the waist added sweetness that didn't overshadow the dress's can't-look-away beading, which appeared almost sticky. I instantly realized this was a red-carpet gown, not just for anyone, but specifically for a modern renegade.</p><img alt="christian dior runway paris fashion week womenswear fall winter 2023 2024" title="Christian Dior : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall Winter 2023-2024" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-christian-dior-womenswear-news-photo-1677610206.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Julien M.

I also thought that it may have been one of the more subversive dresses on the runway.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dior's fall 2023 collection intended to present "a new reading of the history of the 1950s," according to show notes. Catherine Dior, one of the collection's three inspirations, lived through one of history's darkest periods. She was a member of the French Resistance in WWII and a concentration camp survivor. When she was released at the end of the war, she was awarded several medals of honor for her service before turning to a quiet life cultivating flowers and, later, preserving her brother's design legacy through her role as president of the Christian Dior museum.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With this context, I wondered if the ball gown was yet another way Chiuri referenced the heroine at the heart of Dior, alongside all those florals in the decor and other looks. The dress's silhouette was a house classic, but it had an edge conveying decades of strength and power.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Halie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at Harper's BAZAAR.
