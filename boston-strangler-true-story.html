She is the first person to dub the killer ‘the Boston Strangler’, a name that would go down in history as one of America's most notorious and mysterious serial killers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair come up against systemic sexism during the course of their investigation, manifested both in the newsroom, in the police force and in attitudes towards the middle-aged women who were murdered.</p><img alt="boston strangler film" title="Boston Strangler film" width=4096 height=2445 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/8b321602c725e34e55c2f851db812da3-4096x2445-a3aac6ba-64185f41e3f22.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Disney</span><p>Carrie Coon and Keira Knightley</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Women in public spaces – it’s a constant problem," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a43213443/keira-knightley-april-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Knightley told Harper's Bazaar" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Knightley told Harper's Bazaar</a> in her recent cover shoot.

David Dastmalchian, who has previously had roles in a number of superhero – films from The Dark Knight to Suicide Squad – plays Albert DeSalvo, the suspected murderer. The film also stars Alessandro Nivola as a detective and Chris Cooper as Jack MacLaine, McLaughlin and Cole's newspaper boss.</p><img alt="boston strangler film" title="Chris Cooper in Boston Strangler" width=2778 height=1314 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2023-02-21-at-17-3a0b8ee2-6418638f82526.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Disney</span><p>Chris Cooper stars as Jack MacLain in the film, McLaughlin and Cole’s boss</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What happened to the Boston Strangler's victims?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Between 14 June 1962 and 4 January 1964, 13 single women between the ages of 19 and 85 were murdered in the Boston area, with most sexually assaulted and strangled in their apartments. No sign of forced entry into their homes meant that, chillingly, the women were assumed to have let their assailant in – either because they knew him, or because they believed him to be a maintenance or delivery man, which earned him the initial title of 'Phantom Strangler'.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How was the Boston Strangler caught?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On 27 October 1964, a stranger entered a young woman's home posing as a a detective. He tied the woman to her bed, assaulted her and left, apologising as he went. The woman's description of her attacker led police to identify the assailant as Albert DeSalvo. When his photo was published, many women identified him as the man who had assaulted them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">DeSalvo was not initially suspected of being involved with the strangling murders. But after he was charged with rape, he gave a detailed confession of his activities as the Boston Strangler, confessing to every murder and divulging details about the crime scenes that only he could know. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1967.</p><img alt="l r keira knightley as loretta mclaughlin and chris cooper as jack maclaine in 20th century studios' boston strangler, exclusively on hulu photo by claire folger © 2023 20th century studios all rights reserved" title="BOSTON STRANGLER" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boston-strangler-1-641873d63c32e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Disney</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In February of that year, DeSalvo escaped with two fellow inmates from Bridgewater State Hospital, triggering a full-scale manhunt, but he gave himself up the following day. After the escape, he was transferred to the maximum security Walpole State Prison. Six years after the transfer, he was found stabbed to death in the prison infirmary. His killer or killers were never identified.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On 11 July 2013, Boston law enforcement officials announced that DNA evidence had linked DeSalvo to the rape and murder of one (but only one) of the original victims, proving his involvement.</p><img alt="david dastmalchian" title="David Dastmalchian" width=4715 height=6945 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1410347818-6418609bc11c0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Vivien Killilea</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>David Dastmalchian, who plays Boston&nbsp;Strangler Albert DeSalvo in the film</p><img alt="albert de salvo being escorted to court" title="Albert De Salvo Being Escorted to Court" width=2026 height=2784 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-515206752-641860e256da3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Albert DeSalvo, who claimed to be the Boston Strangler, being escorted into court in 1967</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Is there controversy surrounding the case?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the women killed were from a variety of age and ethnic groups, and murdered using multiple methods, many doubted whether it was even one killer responsible, or several.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1968, Dr Ames Robey, medical director of Bridgewater State Hospital, insisted that DeSalvo was not the Boston Strangler. He described DeSalvo as "a very clever, very smooth compulsive confessor who desperately needs to be recognised" – an opinion shared by Middlesex district attorney John J. Droney, Bridgewater superintendent Charles Gaughan, and George W. Harrison, a former fellow inmate of DeSalvo's. Harrison claimed to have overheard another convict coaching DeSalvo about details of the strangling murders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To this day, it has still only been forensically proven that DeSalvo was involved in just one of the murders: that of Mary Sullivan in 1964.</p><img alt="l r keira knightley as loretta mclaughlin and carrie coon as jean cole in 20th century studios' boston strangler, exclusively on hulu photo by claire folger © 2023 20th century studios all rights reserved" title="BOSTON STRANGLER" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/boston-strangler-641871ba03c28.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Disney</span></p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where can I watch Boston Strangler?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The film, which was released on 17 March, 2023 on Hulu, is also available to stream on Disney+ in the UK.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1qbG5ibYFye8Goqq2nnmLAtb7Ap56lnaJiwbPBxGaqraeirnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
