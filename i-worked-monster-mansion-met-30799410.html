And I think we should pay more attention to the ones who lead the country.”</p><p>Kerry started her career at Wakefield Prison, the high-security unit dubbed “Monster Mansion”, and has since gone on to work in a range of different facilities and with police and courts.</p><p>She says: “I work with everyone from shoplifters to serial killers. I’ve met Ian Brady and Peter Sutcliffe. Dennis Nilsen used to stay in regular contact with me – whether I liked it or not.”</p><p>She was also the independent psychologist who assessed Charles Bronson for his parole hearing earlier this year, getting to know him over a two-year period.</p><p>She argued he should be moved to open conditions, but he was denied release by the Parole Board.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29608027.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Charles-Arthur-Salvador-better-known-as-Charles-Bronson.jpg><p>“I’m still in contact with him and I’ve got a couple of pieces of his artwork on my desk,” says Kerry.</p><p>“The trouble is that the system doesn’t know what to do with him. There’s not been a violent incident since 2018.”</p><p>Kerry turns her attention to the murder of five-year-old Logan Mwangi for Monday's episode of discovery+ show Faking It.</p><p>He was found dead in a river in Bridgend, South Wales, in July 2021.</p><p>Logan’s mum Angharad Williamson and her partner John Cole were convicted of his murder, alongside Cole’s 14-year-old son Craig Mulligan. Williamson and Cole were jailed for life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28359354.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Ian-Brady-discloses-location-of-victims-body.jpg><p>Mixed-race Logan was found with 56 external injuries after months of abuse at the hands of Williamson and racist Cole, a former member of the National Front.</p><p>Kerry says: “We find it really difficult to comprehend that women are capable of violence or of allowing something like that to happen to their child.</p><p>“And yet the truth of the matter is that I see this in clinical practice all the time.</p><p>“Logan would still be alive if Williamson had not had a relationship with Cole. The odds were stacked against him as soon as his mother invited that man into her home.</p><p>“You’ve got a child who is mixed race and yet you form a relationship with someone you know is a former member of the National Front.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29344468.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Logan-Mwangi-murder-trial.jpg> Bank Holiday groceries bargains <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Sainsbury’s</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30778560.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_IBP_NEC_210423pharmacy_07JPG.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><b>•</b><span>£10 cashback on a £40+ spend at Sainsbury’s Groceries means that TopCashback will refund £10 cashback when new TopCashback members spend £40 or more at Sainsbury’s Groceries</span></p><p><b>• </b>Offers ends on 30/09/2023 23:59</p><p>This offer can only be redeemed once per household on a first come first served basis.

Logan was an object standing in the way of what she perceived as her future.”</p><p>Logan died from internal bleeding and blunt trauma injuries to his head that were so severe they were more akin to someone involved in a high-speed car accident.</p><p>Kerry says: “What is evident is that Logan did not die instantly from his injuries and he would have been in extreme pain for a long period of time.</p><p>"There was a window of opportunity to get help for Logan and not one of them decided to make that choice.
