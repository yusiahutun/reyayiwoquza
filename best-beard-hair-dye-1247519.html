A beard can be a mix of multiple colors, from naturally darker hair to pesky blondes that sprout in a scattered manner, and salt-peppery grays. A dye’s role is to create a central color for a uniform effect and a voluminous beard. This might take a few hits and trials, but remember to match the dye with your natural beard color for a realistic and organic finish.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Our list comprises of all kinds of products, from organic and natural formulas to chemical-based dyes. Based on your preference, skin type, and need choose the best formula that works for you. Ensure that the product is ammonia-free.&nbsp;</p><p>Shedding more light on the ingredient list, Ghanima Abdullah, a beauty consultant says, “If you're looking for a beard dye, try to stick to ones that are labeled as all natural, like henna and indigo blends or other semi permanent natural dyes. Beard dyes can contain PPD and ammonia to help get the dye to penetrate the coarse hairs of the beard. These same chemicals can also irritate the face.”</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> While sorting down your top picks, consider the application and result time that each product has to offer. There are shampoos, henna powder mixes, brush-on color solutions, and pre-mix dyes available for coloring beard, mustache, eyebrows, and sideburns. Every product delivers varying results, some last for up to a month, while some are only temporary and last a day. Check the labels for details and get your most suited match.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Skin type: </strong>Dyes can be a tricky business when it comes to the formula and ingredients. A patch test for 48 hours is highly recommended. Be it chemicals, fragrances, or even henna, there can be reactions causing redness, irritation, or itchiness. To avoid this, opt for safe ingredients and read the instruction label thoroughly before proceeding.&nbsp;</p><p>From covering premature grays to concealing pesky patches, men need beard dyes to achieve a naturally youthful, darker, and fuller appearance. With at-home and easy-to-use dyes available online, you can skip salon visits and achieve your beard goals with the best beard hair dyes. There are permanent, semi-permanent beard dye, and temporary formats to choose from and achieve desired results.
