There was something poetic about returning to our home at Bridgestone Arena this year, and I am positive that I am not alone in wanting to relive the evening’s many magical moments.”</p><p>The show kicked off with Miranda Lambert, who performed a medley of her fan favorites, but the night also saw performances from Jennifer Hudson, as well as Mickey Guyton, Brittney Spencer and Madeline Edwards, who joined forces for a rendition of Guyton’s new song “Love My Hair,” which received a standing ovation.</p><p>The performance was introduced by 14-year-old activist Faith Fennidy, a young Black girl who, in 2018, left her 6th grade classroom in tears after school officials complained that her hairstyle violated school policy.
