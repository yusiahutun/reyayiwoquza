You are going to think that it was recut, okay?" said Andy, who claimed the episode coincidentally reflects the drama that ensued. "It was not recut. This was the episode."</p><p>The "Watch What Happens Live" host revealed he only recently watched the episode after it was sent to him "weeks ago" and was shocked by its contents following the cheating scandal.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> broke the news that <a href=#>Tom Sandoval</a> and<a href=#> Ariana Madix</a> split after nine years together amid the latter's discovery that the former had been cheating on her with costar <a href=#>Raquel Leviss</a>.</p><p>Sources also told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">outlet</a> that Ariana called things off with Tom after she found text messages -- and a video -- on his phone that were said to be "sexual in nature." The insiders added that Madix told friends she discovered Leviss and Sandoval's alleged affair had been going on for months.</p><p>"I watched it and I was like, 'People are going to think we did this, or we moved stuff up,'" Cohen explained. "The conversations that go on between <a href=#>Katie [Maloney]</a> and <a href=#>Lala [Kent] </a>and Raquel are not to be believed in the light of what has come out. But I'm telling y'all, the episode was not touched. This is how it was going to be shown, which makes it all the more shocking. You won't believe it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1065dd0f-6282-4590-9a49-a3c3f57dedc7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7ff74ee0-c55e-4a91-95cb-765000fb9446 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/5by4/2023/03/09/33cf9af55eb04e1db84945dc0912c86a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lisa Vanderpump on Tom Sandoval, Raquel Leviss Scandal, Apologies and What Schwartz Knew</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>This isn't the first time members of the "Vanderpump Rules" camp have denied recent episodes have been altered. Following March 8th's installment of the series, Lala took to her Instagram Story to dispel fan rumors that the episode was reedited after news Sandoval and Leviss’ alleged affair broke.</p><p>"I may get in trouble for saying this," the 32-year-old reality star explained in a video. "But I'm gonna say it anyway. I heard … people are talking about how editors of VPR probably went back through and, like, tweaked things to kind of, like, align with what happened. Not true."</p><p>"What you guys are gonna see this season — before we obviously know what we know now — was very much going to be the storyline of … you know who," the "Give Them Lala" author seemingly referred to Leviss. "With or without what just happened in the last week."</p><p>"Vanderpump Rules" airs Wednesdays on Bravo.</p><a id=gallery-link-2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7ff74ee0-c55e-4a91-95cb-765000fb9446 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/4by3/2023/03/06/e6c42ba364a84997bd59e2b04f8ef053_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmamxflrulxYycpqGdnmLAqbvCpKCnn12rrq%2BwxKunrqWgYr%2B2uMSsZJ6omai8pbGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
