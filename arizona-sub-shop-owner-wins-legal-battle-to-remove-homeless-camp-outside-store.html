As the crisis increases, homelessness is also on the rise in these states. There are homeless camps at many corners of several cities, and the government isn’t doing much about them.</p><p>In Phoenix, Arizona, an old station sub owner, Joe Faillace, got fed up with the homeless encampment outside his restaurant. He first complained to local authorities, but they didn’t do much to help. Therefore, he took his concerns further and filed a lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p>The shop owner spoke to America’s Newsroom recently, giving an update on the situation. He also confirmed that the police were monitoring his restaurant actively.&nbsp;</p><p>He continued, “I think it’s a permanent fix. There’s definitely more police presence. This was the first time that I can remember that I came down to my restaurant, and there was just no one around. It was just clear. It was nice.”</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Texas Nonprofit Defies City Law, Feeds the Homeless on Christmas Day</a></strong></p><p>Faillace has worked in the neighborhood for almost 40 years and complained repeatedly about the homeless encampments. However, everything changed when he won his case, and a Maricopa County judge ruled in his favor.</p><p>The judge “ordered the city to clear away its largest homeless encampment, a tent city of more than 1,000 residents known as The Zone” on Sept. 20.</p><p>Since they cleared these camps, Faillace cannot believe how different everything is everywhere. “The difference over the last six months is something I never believed was even possible. It’s an entirely new place. Every day feels like a miracle,” he told The Times.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><strong>POLL—Should the Government Increase Taxes on the Wealthy To Reduce Economic Inequality?</strong></a></p><p>The sub-shop owner also spoke to Fox News concerning the recent developments. According to him, he won the case due to the severity of the homeless crisis in Phoenix. “I think that’s one of the reasons why we won the case was because it’s just gotten out of control,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>He continued, “The pee, the poop, the defecation, fornication, the deaths: there was a fetus in the street one day. Somebody murdered somebody and threw him in the dumpster.” The case of the body found burning in the dumpster was a huge wake-up call for Phoenix police in March.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Faillace, he only fully comprehended how bad the situation in Maricopa County was recently. When the New York Times interviewed him for a story, he realized he didn’t know some details about the crisis.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:</strong> <strong><a href=#>California Study Suggests Giving People Experiencing Homelessness Money Can Change Their Lives</a></strong></p><p>“It was insane. It took the New York Times guy coming down here and talking to me for four days to make me realize how bad it really was,” he said. He also mentioned that this <a href=#>homeless</a> crisis extends far beyond Phoenix.&nbsp;</p><p>Many other cities are experiencing similar problems, and the government must fix them. “They (the government) just need to change their mindset. It’s just not in The Zone anymore. It’s all over the city. There’s homeless everywhere now,” he said. Therefore, the government has a long way to go in fixing the homeless situation across the country.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Florida Governor Slams Democratic Jacksonville Mayor for Removing Confederate Statue</a></p><p><a href=#>Principal Fired for Scolding Students Who Didn’t Attend Classes on Indigenous Peoples Day</a></p><p><a href=#>UN Expert Warns Biden Administration’s Title IX Proposal Would Have “Detrimental Effects”</a></p><p><a href=#>Texas Arrests Thousands at the Us-Mexico Border Under “Arrest and Jail” Operation</a></p><p><a href=#>Ten-Year-Old Transgender Girl Condemns Ohio Trans Care Ban</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krrO12ailmmWjqq9uv8eop2anp6Oys3nWoqWsZZyatKK4jJuYraycmnq1u4yrnKanppp6qbvMnqOeq6NisKK5z2amrqyjnrGmedKtpqudXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
