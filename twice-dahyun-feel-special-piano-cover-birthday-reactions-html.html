She also lends her vocals to the group from time to time. But some fans may not know Dahyun is a skilled pianist. For years, the music artist displayed her talents on VLIVE, often playing the piano with her bandmates by her side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_37>On her birthday in 2019, Dahyun dropped a <a href=#>piano cover of Yiruma’s “Reminiscent,”</a> which does not contain a singing part. Then a year later, Dahyun gifted ONCE with another piano cover. This time, performing TWICE’s “Feel Special.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_31>In the 2020 cover, Dahyun performed both the piano and vocals. Then when the musician reached her rap in the song, she stopped singing and played the part on the piano.</p><p id=par-5_19>“Happy birthday to Dahyun and thanks ONCE,” the video said as the “Feel Special” cover came to an end.</p><h2><strong>TWICE fans react to Dahyun’s birthday gift</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DAHYUN-of-TWICE.jpg><p id=par-6_25>After Dahyun’s “Feel Special” piano cover was released on TWICE’s YouTube and VLIVE, fans shared their excitement over the music artist’s talent on social media.</p><p id=par-7_34>“Dahyun singing the <a href=#>entire chorus of Feel Special</a> on her own for the first time… She has the prettiest softest voice,” a fan wrote on Twitter. “I’m so touched she prepared this for us.”</p><p id=par-8_34>“<a href=#>Dahyun singing Feel Special</a> all by herself while playing the piano,” another fan tweeted. “The amount of talent she has is INSANE! there’s a reason why she was accepted to SM YG and JYP.”</p><p id=par-9_13>Meanwhile, other ONCEs expressed their appreciation for Dahyun’s gift on her own birthday.</p><p id=par-10_33>“<a href=#>Dahyun uploaded a piano video</a> for us again on her birthday for the 2nd year in a row even though it’s HER birthday,” a Twitter user wrote. “Everyone say Dahyun best girl #HappyDAHYUNday.”</p><p id=par-11_28>Then some fans couldn’t help but point out this was a beautiful way to say goodbye to the Feel Special era, as More & More arrives next week.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_36>“I thought having <a href=#>OT9 Feel Special dance practice</a> was enough to end this era,” a fan wrote. “But here is Dahyun giving us one last gift <a href=#>before ending Feel Special</a> era.

Some of the members have also shared a few spoilers about the lead single.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_35>“While ‘Dance the Night Away’ had bouncy choreography, ‘Fancy’ and ‘Feel Special’ was complex,” Sana said in TWICE’s <a href=#>jacket-making film</a>. “This time, it’s a combination of those two. That’s the concept of ‘More & More.’”</p><p id=par-16_31>Dahyun’s birthday cover of “Feel Special” may have been our last goodbye to the era, but there’s still plenty to be excited about when TWICE delivers their comeback.
