With his movie premiering today, FIRST for Women sat down with St. John to learn everything you need to know about this challenging yet beautiful tale about grief, mortality and facing one’s mistakes before it’s too late.</p><p>The Young and the Restless star also talks about being locked in a soapy love triangle with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eileen Davidson</a>’s Ashley and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zuleyka Silver</a>’s Audra, and what he thinks of his character Tucker McCall (who was previously played by Days of Our Lives star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Nichols</a>).</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Y&R’ Star Eileen Davidson Opens Up About Relationships, Self-Care and Thwarting Cancer: “Life Is Not an Easy Journey”</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Trevor St. John explores grief and hope in his film, A Good Enough Day</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In A Good Enough Day, St. John leads a small cast that includes One Life to Live alum and Good Trouble star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sherri Saum</a> and one-time General Hospital villain <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Wingate</a>, and yet often finds himself alone on screen. His character, Tyler, is a man whose grief has led him to pull away from his family and as he faces his own mortality, he begins to see the cost of his neglect — especially on his daughter.</p><p>“The movie asks some questions that should make you uncomfortable,” St. John warns. “The most common feedback we’ve gotten is that it sticks with you. It’s forcing people to think about things, and I think that’s wonderful.”</p><p>As his character attempts to say his goodbyes, St. John takes viewers on what is an emotional, internal journey.</p><p>“Inner conflict is sometimes difficult to depict in a film,” he says. “But we peel back little layers of the onion, letting the audience know just enough to understand what isn’t being said. We also allowed the audience to know something his sister, his ex-wife, and his daughter don’t. That creates intrigue and hope.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-1474289363-e1707842189323.jpg><p>While this is an original tale, St. John teamed up with his producer and cinematographer stepfather, Don Hamilton, and his cousins and cowriters, Brett Clothier-Sharman and Graham Sharman, to craft what feels like a very personal story.</p><p>“Like every family, we’ve had our share of loss and dealing with grief, death and dissolution of relationships,” St. John says. “I lost my sister to a car accident when I was 15, and I saw what it did to my mother. The whole family did, and it never really left us. It wasn’t that we set out to explore that, but we had it on our repertoire.”</p><p>With A Good Enough Day premiering today on Amazon TVOD, AppleTV, and Tubi, St. John can’t wait to share it with the world.</p><p>“I’ve always felt it’s a minor miracle that any movie gets made,” says the co-writer, star and director. “So it was an accomplishment to see this to its completion, and then to have it released? I’m just thrilled.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Young and the Restless star Trevor St. John talks Tucker and Ashley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/YnR-stars-Trevor-St-John-and-Eileen-Davidson-as-Tucker-and-Ashley-1-e1707842685218.jpeg><p>While St. John’s film grapples with mortality and connection, his character on The Young and the Restless seems to want to forge lasting connections, as well. Unfortunately, Tucker also has an insatiable need to dominate. Whether he’s eying Chancellor-Winters or Jabot, the businessman seems willing to cross anyone – including his own son, Devon – to accomplish that.</p><p>“Tucker is very deeply feeling, but he gets in his own way,” St. John admits. “He doesn’t have very good boundaries and he’s not very thoughtful. Sometimes I like him, and sometimes I can’t stand him, but I love the dichotomy. And his impulsivity. The most interesting characters are walking contradictions.”</p><p>For all Tucker’s machinations, flirtations and romances, he keeps coming back to Ashley Abbott. While St. John assumed the role in 2022, Ashley and Tucker have been circling each other since Katherine Chancellor’s long-lost son first arrived on the scene in 2013.</p><p>“I don’t know what she sees in Tucker,” St. John admits. “But Tucker loves Ashley’s sense of self. She’s well-spoken, super bright, and obviously beautiful. She’s also strong-willed and comfortable in her own skin – or at least, she was.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>St. John is referring to the recent confusion surrounding Tucker and Ashley’s breakup in Paris. Some Genoa City locals were convinced Tucker was gaslighting Ashley over what went down after she dumped him. Now, it’s starting to look like there’s more to this story.</p><p>While Tucker seems baffled by Ashley’s recent behavior, St. John can’t say enough about working with portrayer Eileen Davidson.</p><p>“She is ultra-talented,” he raves. “She’s open to whatever happens in the moment, and lately, I’ve seen her just start to fly, man. She’s just gone into a different stratosphere. And she’s such a great person. I just like her company.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Young and the Restless star Trevor St. John talks Tucker and Audra</h2><p>While St. John stepped into an existing romance with Davidson’s Ashley, he’s had “a ball” creating something new with Zuleyka Silver, who plays scheming seductress Audra.</p><p>“Talk about another person who is really dear to me,” he gushes. “I see her on set, and I light up. We have such a great time together.</p><p>“And it’s a completely different dynamic,” he continues. “The character’s feisty and doesn’t take crap from anybody. And obviously, she’s mesmerizingly beautiful. They both are, but what’s more important is WHO they are – and I’d like to give Tucker the credit for understanding that.”</p><p>With Ashley pushing him away yet again, Tucker has fallen back into bed with his protégé <strong>–</strong> who is as duplicitous as he is and yet, his most trusted confidante.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/Young-Restless-star-Trevor-St-John-Tucker-Zuleyka-Audra-e1707832801604.jpg><p>“While everyone in Genoa City finds Tucker repulsive, she sees beyond the surface and all his impulsivity,” St. John maintains. “He feels seen by her and appreciates for who he is. She’s the dearest friend he has.”</p><p>“She might make a move, businesswise, and try to best him,” he concedes. “There’s competitiveness there, but Tucker trusts she would never do anything to ruin him or destroy his sense of self. She would never leave him destitute or completely friendless.”</p><p>As for whether Tucker is actually over Ashley, as he keeps telling Audra he is, St. John hedges, “There could be some truth to that…but what is he over? I don’t think it’s plausible he’d no longer care, at all.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OLTL alum Trevor St. John is happy in his new daytime home</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/2170932_1011b-e1707833159636.jpg><p>With his film A Good Enough Day out for audiences, St. John has enjoyed his return to daytime as Tucker – and he reveals it was an old One Life to Live pal who convinced him to join The Young and the Restless, to begin with!</p><p>“My dear friend, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Easton</a>, who is on General Hospital said, ‘Hey, man, I’ve heard nothing but terrific reviews about the dynamic on set and the people there,’” St. John recounts. “And it turns out, he was spot on. It’s almost too good to be true! Everyone’s so collaborative. I feel so appreciated, and in turn, I feel fortunate to be there.”</p><p>While St. John can’t reveal what the future holds for Tucker and the women he loves, it sounds like the drama is just heating up. &nbsp;</p><p>“Right now, with all that’s going on with Tucker, it’s some pretty heavy stuff,” St. John teases. “But there’s always that undercurrent of devil may care attitude and lightheartedness, with Tucker – and I think you’re going to see a little bit more of that soon.”</p><p>The Young and the Restless airs weekdays at 12:30 p.m. ET / 11:30 a.m. PT on CBS and streams on Paramount+. St. John’s film, A Good Enough Day, premieres today, February 13, streaming on Amazon TVOD, AppleTV, and Tubi.</p><p><strong>Want more on your favorite soap stars?
