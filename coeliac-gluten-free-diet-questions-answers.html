Online</strong> have had a chat with expert Ann Perkins, who has been diagnosed as coeliac herself, and since established her own <strong>gluten-free</strong> range of products with PERK!ER.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8677703a4d04-zooey-a.jpg><p id=es6mzX3j8VjW data-wc=8><strong><strong>New Girl star Zooey Deschanel has coeliac disease</strong></strong></p><p id=eWFUvZH7Fwab data-wc=48>We ask the expert – who has a career in the food industry and works closely with The Coeliac Association – about her own personal experience, what to look out for if you think you're coeliac, for examples of naturally <strong>gluten-free dishes</strong> and her top tips for coeliacs.</p><p id=eqoM__CAMxl data-wc=79><strong><strong>How did you discover you were coeliac?</strong>&nbsp;</strong>After a number of years of different symptoms, which were never really understood by a doctor, my partner Steve and I realised that some food was definitely causing me issues, and that it might well be gluten, as when I reduced the amount of wheat in my diet I felt so much better. I went back to the doctor's and insisted on a referral to a specialist, and then I was diagnosed.</p><p id=e9zaldWPMti data-wc=48>The average time for diagnosis is estimated to be 13 years as many symptoms can be misinterpreted as IBS, or the strains of a busy life. I think in my case it could have been 20 years, as some symptoms went back to when I was very young.</p><p id=e7B_jPerzsso><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3db280c25d56-lemon-drizzle-z.jpg></strong><p id=ekx48cdrhUxO data-wc=4><strong>&nbsp;<strong>Gluten-free lemon drizzle cake</strong></strong></p><p id=eRZlqHm9CYCy data-wc=60><strong>What are the symptoms someone might be suffering if they are coeliac and don't know it?&nbsp;</strong>Symptoms vary from one person to the next, but can include bloating, abdominal cramps, constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, wind, tiredness, headaches, sudden or unexpected weight loss, hair loss and anaemia. Many consumers also complain of "brain fog" – not being able to think so clearly.</p><p id=e-scXyPvzOB data-wc=51>It is now medically recognised that some people with coeliac disease don’t have any recognisable physical symptoms but still have the damage to their gut on the inside, so if you do have a family history of coeliac disease it’s a good idea to ask your doctor for a blood test.</p><span><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5b2cc4ec0426-risotto-quinoa-a.jpg></strong></span><p id=e8ScfcSo168n data-wc=4><strong>Quinoa is gluten free</strong></p><p id=eg83ag2fUrnC data-wc=38><strong>Any restaurant tips for coeliacs?</strong>Call ahead if you can to check they can cater for you, as some restaurants are more restricted than others in the food they have available and the methods they use for food preparation.</p><p id=e0bzJ_wnBKo data-wc=73>When you arrive, make sure you mention to your waiter that you need a strict gluten free meal. Make sure they understand what gluten is, gluten is in wheat, barley and rye. Sometimes I do meet staff in restaurants that confuse gluten with dairy.Tip: Sauces and soups which may have been thickened with wheat flour and food fried in the same oil as a battered food, meaning the batter will contain wheat flour.</p><span><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/21eda8154d4e-porridgeginger-a.jpg></strong></span><p id=eHHCQ-AG2yY4 data-wc=45><strong>Can you name some meals/desserts that are naturally gluten-free?</strong>Gluten is found in wheat, barley and rye, so all meat, fish, fruit, vegetables (including pulses and beans) and dairy is naturally gluten-free, as well as many grains like rice and corn, and the ancient grain quinoa.</p><p id=e0Hk58geJHu data-wc=38><strong>Naturally gluten-free dishes&nbsp;</strong>• Roast dinner (just watch the gravy)• Rice based dishes (be careful with sauces and soy sauce)• Soup• Indian (without the naan unless it's gluten free)• Salad• Pavlova• Ice-cream and Sorbets• Mousse and Panna Cotta</p><span><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/998c364504d4-butternut-squash-soup-z.jpg></strong></span><p id=eeQAc_zTM1WH data-wc=8><span><strong>&nbsp;Gluten-free butternut squash soup</strong></span></p><p id=eUazZoDQz4Rz data-wc=4><strong>5 tips for coeliacs?</strong></p><p id=e5DPNzJ24m data-wc=31>1.
