The new spin-off marks the third time he has played Anakin Skywalker following on from 'Attack of the Clones' and 'Revenge of the Sith'. Both of those prequel films were directed by 'Star Wars' creator George Lucas. This time around, Deborah Chow gets behind the director's lens.</p><p>'Obi-Wan Kenobi' revolves around the aftermath of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skywalker's turn to the Dark Force</a> and the scar it leaves on his teacher (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ewan McGregor</a> returns as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jedi Master Obi</a>). As a quick refresher, the series does give a quick recap before switching to the new storyline. Needless to say, fans were ecstatic after getting their first look at Vader.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Obi-Wan Kenobi': Fan review: 'Knew Deborah Chow wasn't going to disappoint'</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Obi-Wan Kenobi's story will work better as a TV series, and 'The Mandalorian' shows us how best to go about it</a></p><p>"Oh my god just watched #obiwankenobi and the last part where Darth Vader shows up got me so hyped!!
