Indira said Vltchek, a naturalised American who was born in the Soviet Union, had been severely ill for weeks and had refused medical treatment, according to the magazine, which in an op-ed article last week described the journalist as a “revolutionary fighting for the underclass, a lifetime communist and advocate of Chinese globalism.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When contacted, Indira said she would be unable to comment in time for publication. Efforts to contact Turkish authorities were unsuccessful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/10/02/ae0eeda0-049b-11eb-88c7-25dcd0ae6080_1320x770_190127.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Erkin Öncan, a friend of Vltchek who works for the Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik in Turkey, said it was common for authorities to record deaths as suspicious while they were being investigated. He added that English-language media reports had given a misleading impression of the case.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is about Turkish law; ‘suspicious’ is also considered as ’unknown for now,’” Öncan said, describing media reports as “absolutely exaggerating” the circumstance of his death.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The medical report on Andre‘s death has not yet been published. However, according to the preliminary results, the cause of death is health problems,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Öncan said Vltchek had been drawn to China due to his self-proclaimed communist and anti-imperialist views.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Andre also saw China as a powerful socialist country and defended China on all fronts,” he said. “He always exposed the aggressive face of the United States on matters such as Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and the trade war.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">HSBC, Spark Alliance and the law behind latest fury in Hong Kong protests</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an opinion piece published in China Daily in July, Vltchek claimed anti-government protesters in Hong Kong had been “paid well” to “destroy China”, echoing Beijing’s claims that unrest in the city was the result of paid provocateurs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The journalist did not offer any evidence for his claims. Hong Kong police have accused activists of paying some young people to attend protests through the fundraising platform Spark Alliance HK, allegations which have been denied by figures close to the group and for which no charges have been brought.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is all extremely bad theatre,” Vltchek wrote. “But a deadly, effective one. And actors are paid well, royally. Therefore, if not stopped, they will make sure not to abandon their roles.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, Vltchek wrote a China Daily op-ed piece repeating Beijing’s claims that re-education camps for Uygurs in Xinjiang were in fact “vocational training centres”, where he said people were taught “skills and the Chinese language so they can lead a gainful life and avoid falling prey to ‘terrorist and religious extremist’ ideologies”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">United Nations experts believe more than one million Uygur and other ethnic minority Muslims in the far western region have been detained in the camps without charges or trial, in what activists say amount to crimes against humanity and cultural genocide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Angelo Giuliano, a financial consultant and entrepreneur in Hong Kong who corresponded with Vltchek and is regularly quoted in Chinese state media, described the journalist’s death as a “big loss for real, investigative journalism and for pacifists, anti-imperialism, multipolar world supporters”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Dewey Sim</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2FlgHqEmGibnpmknXqxvs5mmqGhnpZ6tr%2BMo6auqp6Wuaq%2F02aqqZmioMBus9GinJ9lkaOxbq%2FOp6qpoaKWsLo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
