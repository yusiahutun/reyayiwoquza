I don’t know if I’ve ever told you that. I want to say thank you to the members of the Recording Academy for voting this way, but I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans. So I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I have been keeping from you for the last two years.”</p><p>On Wednesday, April 17, 2024, Swifties everywhere flooded social media claiming that&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Taylor Swift’s&nbsp;Tortured Poets Department&nbsp;leaked</a>, with some revealing that they had been taken from a Google Drive link containing the entire 17-song list.&nbsp;DailyMail.com&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>reported seeing a screenshot</a>&nbsp;from a Swifties group chat in which a file containing the allegedly leaked album has been shared, along with lyrics from the upcoming record.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Taylor Swift's "Fortnight Lyrics"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/December-8-2017-Joe-Alwyn-supports-Taylor-Swift-at-her-concert.png><p>Now, fans are dissecting Taylor Swift’s “Fortnight Lyrics” and what they could mean. First off, the word “fortnight” is a word commonly used in British English—it means two weeks. The use of British English is interesting because, as we all know, her most serious relationship was with English actor Joe Alwyn; they dated for 6 years and broke up in 2023.</p><p>Some fans have speculated that this song is in reference to the two-week period where Taylor and Joe’s relationship began to disintegrate. Or perhaps it’s about Taylor imagining what their life would be like if they’d stayed together and how mundane their existence would be because he wanted a life out of the spotlight. Read them below and judge for yourself.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>Verse 1</h2><p>I was supposed to be sent away but they forgot to come and get me<br>I was a functioning alcoholic ’til nobody noticed my new aesthetic<br>All of this to say I hope you’re okay, but you’re the reason<br>And no one here’s to blame but what about your quiet treason</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Chorus 1</h2><p>And for a fortnight there we were<br>Forever&nbsp;running&nbsp;to you<br>Sometimes ask about the weather<br>Now you’re in my backyard, turned into good neighbors<br>Your wife waters flowers.
