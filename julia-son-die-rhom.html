Julia and her ex, Edouard Stern, welcomed their first child together, a son named Maximilien Stern, in October 1999. Julia’s son was five months old when he died in 2000 at Necker Children’s Hospital in Paris from shaken baby syndrome while in the care of a Bulgarian nanny named Maya that Eduoard had hired. Julia and Edouard had broken by the time of her son’s death.</p><p>A concealed autopsy report revealed traces of diazepam, a sedative used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures, were found in Julia’s son’s bloodstream, according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/9488439/rhom-julia-lemigova-son/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>. A medical examination also suggested that Julia’s son had been shaken violently and potentially ied from shaken baby syndrome. The nannny disappeared before charges could be filed. The police stated at the time that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a prosecution. The case was reopened in 2010, but was still never solved, according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-11595215/The-wife-vowing-fight-alongside-Martina-Navratilova.html rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>“I don’t know if I ever completely survived the loss of my son,” Julia told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://pagesix.com/2022/02/26/rhom-star-julia-lemigova-on-wife-navratilova-losing-son/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> at the time. “Part of me is dead forever. At the time, I simply didn’t want to live. Selfishly, I wanted to end my life so many times. I wanted to join my son. I wanted to go away. In this horrible pain and through years of grief, I found joy in helping other people. Many women have told me they don’t know how you can survive something like this and not go completely insane, not kill yourself. How can you keep living, have more children, redo your life? It’s very, very difficult, but I’m proof that, yes, you can … [my wife] Martina [Navratilova] helped me a lot.”</p><p>In Season 6, Episode 14 of The Real Housewives of Miami, Julia revealed that the death of her son was why she’s no longer religious. “I went to church, but I still didn’t get any answers. In my case, it gave me more grief and pain. I just cannot walk into a church that easily,” Julia said in a confessional interview as the cast went to the Cathedral Metropolitana in Mexico City, Mexico.</p><p>Later in the episode, while on a gondola ride through the Island of Dolls, Julia was triggered by a strings of dolls that hung on lines between trees. The gondola captain explained that the Island of the Dolls originated from a man named Julian Santana, who was grieving a woman who had drowned in the area and would pray to the dolls for comfort.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn8KttcBmqqimXZm2pnnRoaamZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
