Princesses and queens represent our ideal of what a woman should be, and naturally this image has changed with the course of history. Towards the end of the last century, the landscape started shifting for women; from the birth control pill to the equal pay act, women were given more rights than ever before and - for the first time - a voice. Some Disney films reflected this change with strong female characters like Pocahontas, Mulan and, more recently, characters like Brave.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With the royal wedding looming, Meghan Markle proves that being a princess today holds a different meaning. Donna Dawson, a lead psychologist, has unveiled the traits that a real-life princess should follow to recognise the power of the woman.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Self confidence: <strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Today a prince is more of a PR man for the royal family, spending his days visiting the people and supporting their causes, both physically and emotionally. He needs a partner who can share this work with him, who isn’t afraid to be constantly on public display – especially with social media. However, ‘self-confidence’ for today’s princess is also about knowing who she is and what she has to offer, and never losing sight of that.”</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Diplomacy:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A princess who can handle people tactfully, appear interested when she isn’t, laugh at jokes that aren’t funny, and never show irritation is a must in today’s world. This also means never losing her temper in public.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">A 'down to earth' attitude:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A princess should never act like a spoiled princess, but have an understanding and an empathy for how ordinary people live, share their interests, and show a willingness to ‘rough it’, if necessary.”</p><img alt="Clothing, Street fashion, Fashion, Uniform, Suit, Headgear, Formal wear, Event, Outerwear, Hat, " title="Clothing, Street fashion, Fashion, Uniform, Suit, Headgear, Formal wear, Event, Outerwear, Hat, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-1521819420.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Sense of humour:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This trait is even more important when things go wrong, as it defuses stress for everyone involved.

This means not being thrown when things change; and being as comfortable on her own as she is in a room full of strangers.”</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">A balanced outlook:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This means sharing the interests of her prince, but also having her own interests and passions; being able to give and to receive emotional warmth, but without being emotionally needy and demanding; and being able to lend a hand, cooperate and compromise when needed, but also remaining her own person."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BOp5ywq1%2BWf3GCmG5ubm5fa3qktMCrmJyslad6tb7AoqusZZ6asqWxw2arqGWSmnqiecyom56qnmK9s7XNnJysq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
