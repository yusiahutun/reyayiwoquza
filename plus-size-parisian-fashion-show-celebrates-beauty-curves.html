And the curvier among them are tired of being dictated to about what they can wear, as they showed on a plus-size Parisian catwalk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2014/12/01/n6.gif?itok=uwHIbT0K">From horizontal stripes to a bra playing peek-a-boo under a blazer, buxom models taking part in a show organised by Pulp Fashion Week on Friday put paid to the myth that the ideal, chic French woman is wafer thin.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We have always been told that round women cannot be beautiful and sexy, that you have to dress yourself in old-fashioned stores," said Blanche Kazi, who founded the plus-size Pulp Fashion Week in 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said the idea that only the minuscule sizes seen in magazines represented real beauty was "dictatorship".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Look at my models, they are size 42 to 50 [US 10 to 18, British 14 to 22] - and they all have a voluptuous beauty."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sexy lingerie, cocktail chic, and summer dresses: the clothes seen on the runway in a prelude to Pulp Fashion Week in April are not that easy to find in Parisian stores in these sizes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Plus-size fashion has expanded rapidly in recent years, with runway shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris and designers increasingly adapting to the fact that skinny models are far from the norm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">France has long been associated with the stereotype that its women can guzzle red wine, eat cheese, baguettes and pastry, skip working out and never gain an inch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is an image that has fuelled countless English-language books such as the bestseller , whose author Mireille Guiliano followed up with a cookbook and runs a website by the same name.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But although the country's traditional culture of eating may long have kept the French slimmer, the popularity of American-style fast-food joints like Starbucks and McDonald's has led to expanding girths and a growing problem with obesity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 2012 study by ObEpi-Roche showed French women's waists had expanded by 6.7cm in 15 years. The French Clothing Industry Union said that the average-sized woman had gone from a 38 in 1970 to a 40 today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clothing brands have taken notice, but few in France offer bigger sizes. In Paris, the concept store Women Curves opened in September, but the shop remains an exception.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curvy fashionistas bemoan the difficulty of finding trendy clothes in France, and travel London or New York to do their shopping, or turn to the internet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pulp Fashion Week's artistic director Lalaa Misaki gave up and created her own clothing line, but still feels acceptance for her size is hard to find in France.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"When I go to New York I feel free, I dress like the other women. In Paris if I wear something short, if I expose some flesh, I get nasty looks," she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kazi said hyper-fashion aware Parisians feared curvy women chipped away at the image of the perfect French woman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The media objects to giving us attention because they are afraid of curvy women being seen as obese women," she said.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Curvy fashionistas defy stereotypes of French chic</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2aDdn6TbmhoqJyqwG6%2FyLOcZqiRp7a0tcCnZJ%2BZo522sLqMrJ%2Bor12Ysq2xwauYrZ2jYq%2BmrdStsGabpafDpr8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
