He was in a great mood, and it definitely seemed like a date.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/matt-lauer-annette-roque.jpg><p>In Touch has also reported that many of Matt’s friends think he is seeing the same woman he was spotted on his yacht with in 2014. “They are going strong, but Matt is doing everything in his power to keep her a secret,” the insider added. “He’s been working very hard to have a good relationship with his kids, so he’s worried about what they’ll think.”</p><p>According to a recent report from Page Six, Matt has agreed to pay Annette $20 million in the divorce because he feels bad about cheating on her with other women. “Matt’s bending over backwards to give Annette everything she wants because he feels so guilty. But he would love the Hamptons home,” an insider revealed to the news outlet.</p><p>Luckily for Matt, however, things have been going relatively smooth with their split. “Things really have settled down. Matt and Annette are getting on and they’re both spending time with their kids,” the source added. “They hope to settle the divorce very soon.”</p><p>Perhaps that’s why Matt reportedly wants to keep his alleged new romance on the down-low. An insider told In Touch, “The last thing he needs right now is to upset his wife by flaunting a sexy, younger replacement.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmK2sXaGutrHRZpuarJmjtG6txpqgp2WUnsOwvsKeZJqmnprBtbGMq6aqrZVifneAl2xsaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
