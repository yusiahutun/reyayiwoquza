There are many effective ways to avoid conflict and one cardinal rule of doing this is not to take things personally.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When you are able to do that, you can let go of the need to be “right”. When you don’t have the desire to be correct all the time, this gives you both room to negotiate and the space to calm down.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s important to be honest with the other person so that they know how you are feeling, and to share what is making you angry. Being honest, direct, and communicating in a respectful yet assertive manner is a good starting point.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To manage anger more effectively, it might be better to understand what triggers this complicated emotion.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">One of the most difficult things when anger is directed at us by a loved one is to not to personalise it and become defensiveQuratulain Zaidi, clinical psychologist</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clinical psychologist Quratulain Zaidi, founding director of Hong Kong-based MindnLife Psychology Practice, says: “According to American psychologist Paul Ekman’s research, anger is one of the six ‘basic emotions’ identified in the Atlas of Emotions, along with disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She says it is completely valid to feel this emotion.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How to forgive your partner and why it makes you stronger</span></p></a></h3>“A person might express anger to mask emotions that cause them to feel vulnerable such as hurt or shame. It is often described as a secondary emotion in psychology, as it is often used to protect people from feeling raw, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">vulnerable</span></a>, and other overwhelming feelings.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/13/6fe89536-f3ec-11ea-8f3b-07283e3f3bd8_972x_035853.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Zaidi, common emotions known to trigger anger are anxiety, shame, sadness, fear, frustration, guilt, and disappointment.</p>“Learning to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">recognise anger</span></a> as both a basic, valid emotion and as a protector of uncomfortable emotions is a first step to understanding and then identifying the underlying feelings.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ask yourself these questions: ‘What is the most common first emotion you experience before anger?’ and ‘What are you protecting and why?’. These questions will enable you to see that it’s not your partner who has made you angry,” she advises.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zaidi explains how managing conflict and anger correctly can benefit your relationship. “Relationship conflict is natural and it has functional and positive aspects. For example, it helps us learn how to better love and understand our partners, deal with changes, and renew connections over time.”</p>She points out that, according to research, in successful <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">long-term relationships</span></a> partners often try to manage, not eliminate conflict.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Totally conflict-free relationships are not necessarily healthy relationships and conflict avoidant couples are not necessarily the most emotionally stable couples,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/13/f157db12-f320-11ea-8f3b-07283e3f3bd8_972x_035853.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By avoiding conflicts, these couples might become emotionally distant. And, by not expressing what they need from one another and the relationship, resentment and dissatisfaction could build up. This can sometimes lead to people looking outside the relationship for their emotional needs to be met, Zaidi warns.</p>Sometimes, she adds, relationships are destroyed because of emotional distance, not <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">conflict</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Managing anger safely, on the other hand, is important as it creates a sense of connection, stability, and security in the relationship, while conflict avoidance is a complete refusal to consider your partner’s perspectives that usually leads to emotional disconnection and divorce,” she warns.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Feeling trapped in your relationship?

However, it is helpful to take a step back and try to understand where their anger maybe coming from.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s never helpful to tell them to ‘calm down’ or ‘you are overreacting’, as it is dismissive of your partner’s feelings and implies that their feelings don’t matter and are unacceptable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/13/6514a84a-f322-11ea-8f3b-07283e3f3bd8_972x_035853.jpg>Furthermore, open and honest <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">communication</span></a> with your partner about what anger means to you can lead to better understanding and managing of conflicts in the relationship, she adds.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Try not to take responsibility or solve your partner’s anger for them just because their anger scares you. Instead, create an empathetic dialogue for you both.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Anger often comes if a goal is being blocked, and it’s important to identify the perceived obstacle blocking the goal to gain better insight into your partner’s anger,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How dealing with your partner’s flaws can help love blossom</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h2 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Steps to manage anger and not direct it at your partner</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1.</strong> Familiarise yourself with your anger and identify your anger precursor.
