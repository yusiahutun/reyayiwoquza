The agreement will now run through the end of June 2027, demonstrating a continued commitment to Worcester’s vibrant cultural and economic landscape.</p><p>DCU initially became the facility’s naming rights partner in October 2004, officially launching on March 1, 2005. Following a decade of successful collaboration, the partnership was extended for another decade in May 2014. DCU serves over one million members across all 50 states and Puerto Rico, including 118,000 members in Worcester County. It operates 23 branches in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, with five in Worcester County alone.</p><p><strong>Sue Burton Kirdahy, Senior Vice President of Experience at DCU</strong>, expressed pride in the longstanding partnership,&nbsp;“For two decades, DCU has been proud to partner with the City of Worcester to support and promote the DCU Center as a cornerstone of entertainment, business, and community celebrations. This venue partnership continues to provide opportunities to demonstrate appreciation to our members and employees. Stay tuned for our exciting plans to delight DCU members who visit the DCU Center with special benefits, including a new DCU member VIP entrance.”</p><p><strong>City Manager Eric D. Batista</strong> lauded, “This contract extension is continued proof of DCU’s commitment to the City of Worcester and its residents. The arena and convention center are critical to Worcester’s downtown and its identity. The DCU Center is home to many great events in Worcester, including concerts, hockey games, graduations, and many more, all bringing our community together. We look forward to the DCU Center’s continued success as a hub for business, economic development, and culture in Worcester.”</p><p><strong>Sandy Dunn, the DCU Center’s general manager,</strong> reflected on the partnership’s evolution, noting the venue’s continuous growth in offerings and commitment to guest comfort. Dunn expressed enthusiasm for building upon past successes with DCU.</p><p>The extended agreement, spanning until June 30, 2027, grants DCU the option to extend for an additional seven years. It includes enhanced marketing opportunities and exclusive on-site activations for DCU members, such as a dedicated arena entrance and special upgrades for publicly ticketed performances. Additionally, the agreement incorporates provisions for a DCU-branded photo area for graduations and charitable initiatives.</p><p>The agreement outlines a base naming rights fee of $1.8 million for the three-year term, supplemented by annual incentive bonuses tied to performance metrics. This forward-looking partnership underscores a shared commitment to the continued success and vitality of the DCU Center as a hub for culture, commerce, and community in Worcester.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJRoaGlnkai6brPLqJmapF2Wu6V5w5ysZpuVo8GmvoyapaenpaOwpnnNmqSippdiv6qzx62qZp2oqbKvv8iopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
