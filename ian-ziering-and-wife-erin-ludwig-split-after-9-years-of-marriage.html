She is one of the most incredible women I have ever met and the best mom to our kids.”</p><p>Ian and Eric tied the knot in 2010. They share two kids — daughters Mia Loren, 8, and Penna Mae, 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ian-ziering-splits-from-wife.jpg><p>“It has come to my attention that things are being written and said to sensationalize a situation that is simply not sensational,” Ian continued. “Any quote attributed to me is completely false and solely meant by haters to undermine our intention to continue to get along, protect and raise our daughters, and be examples of successful co-parents. We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time as we focus on what is important to us, our girls.” He signed off with, “Peace and love, Ian.”</p><p>Fans were of course rushing to send encouraging words to Ian in the comments section. “I am sorry to hear about this. Wishing you both the best of luck. Prayers sent to the both of you,” one person said. Another added, “Wish you all the best, wisdom, love and support from family and friends. Focus on the positive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ian-ziering-splits-from-wife-3.jpg><p>It is no surprise to see that Ian has nothing but kind words to say about Erin — in fact, he once touched on how grateful he is for his relationship. While “marriage is work, I believe when you find the right person, marriage is like tending a garden. It’s not a struggle,” the Sharknado star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusively told&nbsp;Closer Weekly</a>.</p><p>Ian then went on to praise his love at the time, saying, “My wife is an incredible woman. I’m so proud of her.”</p><p>We are sending nothing but good vibes for Ian and Erin during this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46imKdlqp6ys7XNoGSappRixKqyxGacq6GeYrm2sNainmaroKG2tXnAn6ueql1uerqxwKuqZqeWYrqivtGimKCdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
