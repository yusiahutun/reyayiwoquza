The actress, who wed musician Taylor Goldsmith in the "boho" ceremony, isn't the only celebrity bride who has rejected traditional bridal white in favor of a hue with a little more flavor.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>instagram/mandymooremm</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she wed first husband Gavin Rossdale way back in 2002, Gwen Stefani opted for an over-the-top John Galliano ball gown with a white bodice that faded to a cranberry pink at the hem. Like her signature platinum waves, the look was intended to make a statement. Mission accomplished, if we do say so ourselves.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>UK Press/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jessica Biel, too, bucked tradition for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>a pale pink Giambattista Valli</a> gown at her 2012 wedding to Justin Timberlake in Italy. But is there a reason for the popularity of the pink gown?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I've binge-watched enough episodes of Say Yes to the Dress to know that some brides who walk down the aisle for a second time (like Moore, who was previously married to Ryan Adams) don't necessarily want to wear white twice, that doesn't seem to be the typical motivation — at least, not according to experts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lanie List, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lovely Bride,</a> says that most women who begin thinking pink — about 10% of her customers — are just unconventional, and "want to feel more like themselves" on their big days. "Some brides just don't feel comfortable in such a bright white," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for why brides are feeling unconventional in the first place, List added that perhaps there's a little sense of rebellion to the staunch traditionalism wrapped up in the literal significance of a white dress, though customers don't really share those thoughts with her explicitly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It also doesn't hurt that pink is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>psychologically associated with romance</a>, and with such a wide range of warm and cool tones, it's almost universally flattering. While the soft, peony pink hue that Moore chose is most common, according to List, there are plenty of bridal boutiques (not to mention, ready-to-wear outfitters) that can whip up a pink look in any number of shades, from bubblegum to fuchsia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">List credits designer Hayley Paige for setting the pink trend tone for 2018 with pale dresses in A-line or ball gown styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And it's not just pink that nontraditional brides are gravitating towards. List says that while bright white, ivory, and pink round out the top three most-requested colors, gowns with undertones of blue-gray or lavender are also popular picks for those not looking to blind their guests with bleach-bright white.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our advice? If you're feeling it, just say yes to the (pink) dress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGedlrulxYympqiqlWK9qrrKZq6enJSeu6h5w6ucrKtdmsWxsdGtZKadkaO2r7M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
