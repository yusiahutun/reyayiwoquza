It's time to ask yourself, “How do I find all accounts linked to my email address?”</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>It's best to revisit all your accounts to update your credentials or deactivate them, but it's not always as easy as hitting the “Find My Account” button. Here are some ways you can find all accounts linked to your email address or phone number.</p><h2 id=find-accounts-linked-to-email-for-free>1. Find Accounts Linked to Email for Free</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AnyConvcom__google-third-party-account-access.jpeg><p>If you're prone to signing in to apps and websites through an email platform's quick authorization button, chances are, you won't have to dig too deep to search accounts by email and review your most recently created accounts. We recommend <a href=#>using two-factor authentication methods to keep your accounts secure</a> and prevent unauthorized access.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For accounts that you've created by “Signing Up With Google”, you can simply head over to Gmail's security settings. From there, you can go through the list of connected apps to edit or revoke their access.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Temp-2100x1000_screenshot2-1.jpg><p>To visit this section on Google, go to the <a href=#>My Account</a> dashboard and click the <strong>Security</strong> tab on the left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Temp-2300x1000_screenshot3-1.jpg><p>Scroll down until you come across <strong>Third-party apps with account access</strong> and hit <strong>Manage Third-Party Access</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Temp-2400x1500_screenshot4-1.jpg><p>From here, you'll be able to manage the settings for each app you've connected to your account.

Next, tap <strong>Settings and privacy > Security and account access ></strong> <strong>Apps and sessions</strong>. You'll be able to check out any accounts that you have linked through your Twitter profile.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>On platforms like Facebook, you can specifically decide what you want to share or cut off. For instance, you can stay connected to a third-party account while disabling its access to the pages that you like on Facebook.</p><h2 id=search-your-inbox-for-account-verification-messages>3. Search Your Inbox for Account Verification Messages</h2><p>Another method is to hunt down the confirmation emails from each account creation in your inbox.</p><p>Search for common subject lines these services send you whenever you register for a new account. A few that work well include “signing up” and “thank you”, and keywords like “confirm” or “confirming”.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Temp-2800x1100_screenshot7-1.jpg><p>You can also use Gmail's search operators and keywords for filtering specific subject lines. “Subject: verify” will fetch all the emails with subject lines containing the word “verify”, to name one example. This allows you to discover roughly every app you've linked to your email address.</p><p>If you have multiple email addresses, you probably have more than one account associated with them. Trying to keep track of these accounts can be a daunting task. However, services like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parserr</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MailParser</a> can make things easier for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Temp-2000x1000_parserr.jpg><p>These websites can help you extract specific data from your emails and organize the results into a convenient spreadsheet based on your criteria or rules.

This applies to email addresses and passwords, too.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>While this is a useful feature that can help you populate forms quickly and effortlessly, it's a good idea to <a href=#>manage your autofill settings </a>from time to time to double-check or update your information.</p><p>You can visit your browser's settings and go through the list to find any accounts associated with email addresses long-past that you may have forgotten about.
