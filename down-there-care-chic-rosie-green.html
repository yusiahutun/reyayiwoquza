With my torture, sorry treatment, over I looked strange, like a naked mole rat and it annoyingly made me look wider across the hips. My boyfriend at the time was non-plussed. Regrowth wasn’t a joyous experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezgQ_KXd6oL data-wc=29>But it marked a sea change in down there hair expectations. And when I re-entered the dating scene in my mid-forties, I knew I needed to up my game. &nbsp;</p><p id=eNni-7zDl_w data-wc=15><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Ask a life coach: I'm newly single at 52 –how do I begin dating?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eAlEimO3mBk data-wc=48>Luckily, the industry has caught up with expectations. Laser hair removal has become more accessible and affordable and the laser treatment I had at the The Phi Clinic with the Alma Soprano Titanium machine has been truly life-enhancing. I no longer have to worry about an impromptu swim. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=eT_yJlXdFC8C data-wc=35>It's not just in-clinic treatments that have revolutionised, though. Last year Gillette Venus bought out a range for pubic hair and skin and the specifically designed products mean much better results and much less irritation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/666bd7624da1-b465fae0-e590-489e-a304-4667075441d100000718still004.png><p id=ebF3Ioo1DFuI data-wc=20>The razor is excellent and the shave gel is perfectly designed to deliver the perfect amount of slip and grip.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYO5ipUw8UYF data-wc=52>Another booming area is intimate care. Always warned off using anything but water down there by my mother, who eyed the offerings in the chemist with suspicion (probably with good reason), &nbsp;there are now a multitude of beautifully packaged products that make you feel clean, fresh and comfortable without aggravating delicate skin. &nbsp;</p><p id=eGUD0V34PnA2 data-wc=12><strong>&nbsp;INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why women in their 40s are more confident voicing their desires</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eIDmefotzOjs data-wc=22>Which is great because the truth is, as we get older, we are more susceptible to irritation and infection in that area.</p><p id=ekBk3_MNNSIg data-wc=30>Hormone shifts can cause dryness and sensitivity. expert Dr. Nighat Arif told me she advocates vaginal moisturising as "it helps prevent dryness, itching and making sex more confirmable."</p><p id=ecL41e0fpvAu data-wc=10><strong>&nbsp;RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why we really need to talk about vaginal health</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eoGExBUqndXw data-wc=29>And now there is a slew of new carefully formulated products that are not only gentle, but are shelfie worthy too.

Designed to enhance pleasure, they are no longer shrouded in secrecy and shame, but something to be celebrated. Gwyneth’s Goop made sex toys chic and now Sephora have just created a dedicated ‘sex care’ section stocked with cool brands like Maude (whose co-creative director is Dakota Johnson). &nbsp;</p><p id=ebdk0lLaYr data-wc=29>Meanwhile, new range Vella, whose 'Women’s Pleasure Serum' is designed to stoke arousal, is winning awards and being stocked in your local Boots.
