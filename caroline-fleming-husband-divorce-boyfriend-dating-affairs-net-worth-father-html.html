No one knows this better than Caroline Fleming and her ex-husband, Rory Fleming, the nephew of James Bond creator&nbsp;Ian Fleming.&nbsp;</p><p>Caroline and Rory are&nbsp;parents to two beautiful children: Alexander and Josephine. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Rory and Caroline Fleming with their two children.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: Express.co.uk. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Just like how every relationship is put to the test, so was theirs. But the couple&nbsp;who became&nbsp;reality stars&nbsp;in&nbsp;Denmark, could not hold on to the marriage and chose to get divorced.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason behind the divorce might amaze you because according to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources</a>, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>&nbsp;“Rory’s attitude is that she’s welcome to the money. He certainly didn’t want a prolonged wrangle in court. What makes it more incredible is that it’s not as if he did anything wrong and is paying a penance – Caroline simply said she was bored and wanted a change.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Because of the couple's association with the Danish Royalty and James Bond franchise, their divorce was a much talked about topic as there was a huge amount of&nbsp;money at stake.</p><p>Rory, whose family has a net worth of estimated&nbsp;&nbsp;£1.05 billion, handed over more than £400 million to Caroline without merely a hint of struggle. And Caroline had to stick with the last name Fleming because she had to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">abandon</a> her baroness title when she married a non-royal.</p><p>But the socialite, Caroline, who had gained immense spotlight post-divorce made it to the news after she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">linked</a> with then Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner. Caroline had met her then boyfriend, Nicklas, during a Danish reality show, in which she was featured for renovating her family castle, Valdemars Castle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bendtner was a guest on her show, and they also did a photoshoot together to promote his appearance. After her first encounter with Bendtner, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> her thoughts about him long before the couple dated each other.</p><p>&nbsp;"He is charming and bright and he's very willing to help other people.You never know when our paths will cross again."</p><p>Just&nbsp;two years after that&nbsp;the couple started dating each other.<span style=color:red>&nbsp;</span>The couple got engaged back in 2010 and also announced their pregnancy.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Caroline and Nicklas take a stroll around the city.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: Dailymail.co.uk. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;When everyone was eagerly waiting for the couple to walk down the aisle, they got split only seven weeks after giving birth to their baby and according to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources</a>,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>‘It was a whirlwind romance and they were madly in love – perhaps they did realize in the end they were poles apart in age and outlook .The birth of a child can put a strain on any relationship but there seems to have been more pressure on them both recently in the last couple of weeks.’</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, the ex-couple chose to stay in touch for the sake of their child.</p><p>Now the mother of three is busy juggling her personal and professional life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The former host of Danmarks Næste Topmodel is now the judge of the hit reality show Ladies of London. Besides, she is also the author of two best-selling cookbooks in Danish.</p><p>One is called Baronessen Går I køkkenet&nbsp;which means "Baroness Going in the Kitchen", while the other is called Baronessens sunde fastfood&nbsp;which translates to&nbsp;"The Baroness's Healthy Fastfood."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The model has a net worth of $400 million and spends her lavish life in the most luxurious way possible along with her friends and family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Caroline has always managed to land herself in the spotlight for one reason or another. However, she has not revealed anything about having a boyfriend recently and does not seem to be linked to anyone at the moment.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpyZoqS5qrrEZp2lnZ2eu6h5x66qm5memXqltdWoqZydXZe8urLRopynnF2ZrrW1zaBkmp6Wlrazv4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMn5itoJWne6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
