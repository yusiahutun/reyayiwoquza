And thanks to his supervision, the Hoffman crew on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was always able to extract that gold from the dirt without any complications.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, where is he now? Let’s take a deeper look into this foreman’s life as this Andy Spinks Bio proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Where Is Gold Rush’s Andy Spinks Now?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>After hanging his gold pan for over 4 years, Andy Spinks finally returned to the game in 2022. He is now a part of the Discovery Channel’s new series </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> which features Todd Hoffman’s yet another journey alongside his father, son, and the rest of his crew including Andy, safety manager Jim Thurber, and mechanic Randy Hubler.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those of you confused, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> is not a franchise of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Todd left the show back in 2018, and so did Andy. At the time, Andy had appeared in over 83 episodes of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and 11 episodes of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: The Dirt</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To put it in seasons, Andy appeared on the 3rd,4th, and 5th installment of the popular Discovery franchise.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He was always cautious and positive about finding gold. No wonder, most of the fans still remember his popular quote — “It’s probably gonna be a fight to get to the very end, but one way or another, this team right here, we’ll get there. And we’ll get that thousand ounces.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Discovery, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> fans have watched Todd Hoffman and his crew from the very beginning. They’ve seen him excavate mine after mine for a chance to strike it rich in gold for years. So now, after a four-year hiatus, the Hoffman Crew is back again digging gold around a rundown mine far off the grid 80 miles north of Nome, Alaska.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Trying to save this mine would definitely be a big gamble for the crew. But on the bright side, if they’re successful, Todd will secure the mining rights for the next decade and could build a family legacy.</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold&nbsp;</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>premiered at 10 p.m on March 25, 2022,&nbsp;</span> after the Gold Rush finale.</p><h3><b>Andy Spinks Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Andy Spinks flaunted a net worth of above $800 thousand in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A foreman most of his life, Andy stepped into the limelight in 2012 making his TV debut on the popular Discovery show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Since then, things have only looked up for him. Even after the Hoffman crew went on a hiatus after 2018, he then went on to be associated with the Oregon Department of Forestry.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, an average mine foreman’s salary in the US was around $88 thousand per annum. So, that was probably what Andy got paid as well.</span></p><h3><b>Andy Spinks Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Andy Spinks was 53 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He is a year older than his employer Todd Hoffman.</span></p><h3><b>Does Andy Spinks Have A Wife?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, Andy Spinks has a beautiful wife named Gina Leszar Spinks. If you’ve been a long-time </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> fan then you should’ve known this because she has appeared a few times over the show as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Andy married Gina back on August 26, 1989, and the two have been together for over 3 decades. Together, they share a daughter named Kenzie Jo Spinks who is the owner of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dapper Dackel Dachshund</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, a dog breeding program offering long and smooth coat dachshunds with all parents genetically health tested.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The last we checked </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dapper Dackel Dachshund </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>were on their way to completing their CHIC certifications.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking more about Kenzie, she went to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sandy High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sam Barlow High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (from 2 July 2010 to 31 December 2012).
