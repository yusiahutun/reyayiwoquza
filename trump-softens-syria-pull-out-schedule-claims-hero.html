US-backed forces seized the extremists’ de facto capital of Raqa on October 17, 2017.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier this month, Trump announced his Syria withdrawal by tweeting “We have defeated ISIS,” even though thousands of the group’s fighters are thought to still be in Syria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2019/01/01/cdd9c1d4-0d0b-11e9-85d9-37db0e8cf837_1320x770_044054.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Military and security experts contended that Trump was overstating the case and warned against a hasty withdrawal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Afghanistan, Trump also wants to bring home about half of the 14,000 soldiers who remain locked in a war against Taliban guerrillas, but no formal announcement has been made concerning that move.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trump’s planned troop drawdowns, particularly the one in Syria, triggered the resignation of his defence secretary, James Mattis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had expressed concern about Trump’s pull-out, emerged from a two-hour lunch meeting with the president to say that Trump “understands the need to finish the job”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think the president is committed to making sure when we leave Syria that ISIS is completely defeated,” Graham said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another prominent critic of the pull-out was the retired US army general Stanley McChrystal, the former commander of US and international forces in Afghanistan, who on Sunday insisted on ABC’s This Week that a US pull-out might cause “greater instability” in the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever, they would still be unhappy!” Trump tweeted on Monday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZH9yhI9rZ29npKfCrryMrKafrJWjwG6%2F2KugmmWgqrmtec6uq2ark52ypcHLnmScpJGeurR5x56pqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
