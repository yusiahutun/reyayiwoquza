Drake's record for most singles on the chart at once and the record for most debuts on the Hot 100, with 27.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, the album received mixed reviews from critics, and the Recording Academy (which runs the Grammys) may have been unwilling to nominate Wallen again due to his past racist behavior.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In February 2021, TMZ published a video of a seemingly drunken Wallen returning to his home near Nashville, while his friends made plenty of commotion and honked car horns.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After an angry neighbor began filming his antics, the musician shouted that someone should 'take care of this p***y-a** motherf*****,' before calling them a 'p***y-a** n*****' as he went into the house.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wallen apologized in a statement after the incident was revealed, but his music was temporarily taken off multiple high-profile radio stations, and several streaming services removed his music from public playlists.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The country hitmaker's record label Big Loud suspended him from his recording contract indefinitely, and several country award shows removed content he had previously filmed for them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His then-new album Dangerous: The Double Album was also made ineligible at the upcoming ceremony by the Grammy Awards.</p><img id=i-3165174a1f8f7517

even more, and Dangerous' sales rocketed up in the immediate aftermath.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He helped make amends by donating $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition, while singling out 20 Black artists.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Six months after the video first was published, Wallen's music began appearing on the radio again, and since then he has been performing in front of large crowds as if the scandal never happened.</p><p class=postsid
