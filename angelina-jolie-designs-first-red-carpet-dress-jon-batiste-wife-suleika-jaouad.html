The renowned actress and director can now add stunning dress designer to her impressive resume after one of her gowns made its red carpet debut Sunday night.</p><p>"This dress was designed by the one and only Angelina Jolie," Suleika Jaouad, wife of Oscar-winning musician <a href=#><strong>Jon Batiste</strong></a>, told <a href=#><strong>CTV Etalk</strong></a>.

It's not a one-off or anything, either, with Guest's caption noting the dress was designed the new fashion label Atelier Jolie.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The gown itself was made from upcycled silk, per <a href=#><strong>People</strong></a>, as part of the label's sustainability focus. And designing the dress for Jaouad, who stars alongside her husband in the documentary film American Symphony, was intentional for Jolie.</p><p>"I have such deep admiration for Suleika and the way she lives her life â€” how she meets difficulty with strength and grace," Jolie told <a href=#><strong>Vogue</strong></a>, adding that she's a "brilliant creative force who inspires everyone who knows her."</p><p>In fact, Jolie is so inspired by Jaouad she told the outlet, "I would have dressed her for anything she needed; It should never be about the dress, but how anything worn feels like an extension of the person."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a4ac3db8-53f2-410a-b169-74431643a0f5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ccb0e632-ba60-4c28-a971-081a067acc38 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/28/5by4/2023/12/05/28a4290552064ef3b6f18c0bf2da508c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Angelina Jolie Says She Doesn't 'Have a Social Life,' Kids Are Her 'Closest' Friends</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In fact, the dress was designed specifically for Jaouad, with Jolie saying, "It was an exercise in what could be found and used, and for us to be creative. We laid out the panels and discussed where they would fall on her body."</p><p>Guest then used a Japanese technique to paint directly on the upcycled silk. "It's called sumi-e, and it's an ancient way of drawing, with sumi ink," he said of his first time creating directly on to silk.</p><p>"I was nervous because I didn't want to mess up," he said. "But I put on Jon's music, and didn't think, and went with the full inspiration and moved as fast as I could."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7d3ae823-47e3-43c1-adb0-1064c02d82ac data-container-ref=toofab:article:ccb0e632-ba60-4c28-a971-081a067acc38 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a7/5by4/2024/01/04/a7aec6f9bef240f6a0d321efedc18c3b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Angelina Jolie's Brother James Haven Speaks Out About Relationship with Actress in Rare Interview</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Her theme in the design was one of creative healing, she explained to Vogue, which she saw as a major theme also of Jaouad's film with her husband that deals with the return of her leukemia.</p><p>She also took inspiration from the fact Jaouad is a painter to have the dress serve as a canvas, enlisting Guest to help bring the full vision to life.</p><p>"Chaz and I have known each other for years, and I knew he would approach this with the dedication and intention needed to feel right," said Jolie.</p><a id=gallery-link-2c8cf09f-3796-4e54-b7d1-50ff070e71f5 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2c8cf09f-3796-4e54-b7d1-50ff070e71f5 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ccb0e632-ba60-4c28-a971-081a067acc38 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fd/4by3/2024/03/10/fdf8a401728f4c93af790a21fb279c4f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmamlflruoscuipZplmqS5qrGMnZysoZejwG6yyKuqrWWimrFur8Crp56sXZm%2Fpr%2FSZqGopl2XrrW10q2cZq%2BZm7Juv9SlnKKjkWK3orvUmpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
