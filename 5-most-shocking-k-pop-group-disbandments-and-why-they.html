They took most of Asia by storm with their popular songs Rising Sun and Mirotic.</p>When members Jaejoong, Junsu and Yoochun announced that they would be leaving TVXQ in 2010, it threw the group, its fans and even the entire industry into chaos. The three members filed a lawsuit against their management agency SM Entertainment over <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“contract length” and “unfair profit distribution”</span></a>, according to The Kraze Magazine. This brought attention to so-called “slave contracts” in the industry – referring to unfair, long-term contracts between the stars and their agencies, according to The Korea Times.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">4 Korean stars who found fame … with a little help from celebrity friends</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/08/7ee5cb87-2b68-4835-ae67-2ba1a7dd518a_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lawsuit filed by the trio had such an impact that it paved the way for negotiations for future stars, according to The Korean Herald. The source added that around 10 agencies in Korea changed their contract years from 13 to seven in the hopes of maintaining peace with the entertainers, and also revised contractual policies that may have been perceived as unjust.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/08/7febd125-eb63-4c77-9ef0-fb622ce3e992_76a53823.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jaejoong, Junsu and Yoochun later formed their own group known as JYJ under C-Jes Entertainment.

The group debuted in 2009 and announced their break up in 2016.</p>According to Koreaboo, there are numerous reasons behind their split. It started with Bom going on indefinite hiatus in 2014 after <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a huge drug scandal</span></a>: a package with 80 amphetamine tablets was sent to her, although it was later revealed to be for medicinal use, according to the same source.

According to The New Paper, B. A. P filed a lawsuit against TS Entertainment to terminate their contract, citing unfair treatment. The article mentions that members of B. A.
