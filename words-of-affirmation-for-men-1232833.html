Be Patient</strong></h3><p><img alt="Words of Affirmation For Men" title="Words of Affirmation For Men" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-11/1699256447_pinkvilla_-67.jpg></p><p>Remember that change takes time, and your partner may need some time to adjust to this new way of expressing affection. Be patient and understanding throughout the process.</p><h3><strong>8. Use Positive Reinforcement</strong></h3><p><img alt="Words of Affirmation For Men" title="Words of Affirmation For Men" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-11/1699256471_pinkvilla_-68.jpg></p><p>Whenever your partner offers words of courage, reciprocate with affection and appreciation.
