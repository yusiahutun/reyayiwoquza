After a tribute to the 101-year-old actor’s iconic film career played, Kirk was brought onstage —&nbsp;during a standing ovation from the audience! —&nbsp;with Catherine to present the night’s award for Best Screenplay for a Motion Picture.</p><p>“Thank you. In 1991, my father-in-law, this living Hollywood legend, Kirk, was recognized by the Writer’s Guild for his role in ending the Hollywood blacklist,” Catherine 48, began. “He not only hired blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo to write the epic Spartacus, but he also had Trumbo receive his proper screen credit for his work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kirk-douglas-golden-globes.jpg><p>(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>After Catherine finished praising her beloved father-in-law, Kirk sweetly chimed in to say, “I wasn’t going to speak, because I could never follow you.” Just a few weeks before the Golden Globes, Kirk <a href=#>celebrated his milestone 101st birthday</a> alongside his family, including his wife, Anne Buydens, 98, and actor son Michael Douglas, 73. “My brother Joel and I [attended] a family celebration for Kirk’s 101st birthday on Saturday [Dec. 9],” Michael wrote on Facebook at the time. “At 101, Dad is a true amazement and a great time was had by all.”</p><p>After recovering from a stroke 20 years ago, <a href=#>Kirk’s health has been steady</a> in recent years. “I was lucky enough to find my soulmate 63 years ago, and I believe our wonderful marriage and our nightly ‘golden hour’ chats have helped me survive all things,” he previously shared with Closer Weekly during an exclusive interview. “I am always asked for advice on living a long and healthy life. I don’t have any. I do believe, however, that we have a purpose for being here. I was spared after a helicopter crash and a stroke to do more good in the world before I leave it.”</p><p>Despite needing a wheelchair and a group of nurses to get him around throughout his day, the film star is showing no signs of slowing down. “He is a constant artist, always working on something. I think that’s the key — feeding that hunger as an artist keeps him from being bored,” his grandson, Cameron Douglas, exclusively <a href=#>revealed to Closer</a>. “He is sort of cruising [into age 101]. I suspect he will be around for a long time!” We hope so!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46koKujXZm8trPLmqpmn5%2Bhsaa6jKCjqJqVqHpzfJBxZGptYGyBc3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
