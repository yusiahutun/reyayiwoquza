A car would pick us up at 6am and it was my job to be the alarm.

It was as if I’d been thwacked in the face with a frying pan in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Eventually, I managed to roll on to the floor. I was groggy and confused. I crawled to the door, opened it, and shouted to Jennifer. She mumbled something and then I heard a thud. None of us could stand up, so we crawled outside."</p><p id=eE1NvsQ2bCR data-wc=54>She added that it then came to light, "We were being poisoned by a carbon monoxide leak from a faulty boiler," and that she is "pretty if we hadn’t had that early morning call, we wouldn’t be here now because we wouldn’t have attempted to wake up and the gas would’ve finished us off."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e782cca88838-gettyimages-849806244.jpg><p id=e3n3vpvYQxo data-wc=18>Dawn and Jennifer famously worked together on their eponymous TV show, French and Saunders between 1987 and 2005.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJMGLHX7qpA data-wc=35>Away from her exploits as a comedian, Dawn is a doting mother and stepmother.
