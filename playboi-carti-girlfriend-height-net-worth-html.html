His sense of style is unrivaled in the industry.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Playboi Carti Gay?</h2><p>Perhaps it was because of his outgoing personality that a gay man named Masin Elije saw him as a great target. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Masin, a well-known Instagram personality and influencer accused Carti of slipping into his DMs in 2017. According to Bossip, the homophobic claim leveled against the Magnolia rapper was eventually debunked.</p><p>Masin made news again a year after the disaster.
