I was p***ing blood and all sorts, I was so dehydrated.</p><p>“But when the fights are coming at that weight – the money fights –you just keep trying to get down to that weight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26480876.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_JS260777345.jpg><p>Since his career switch Tyler now weighs in around the 13 stone mark, and he admitted that he finds it much easier to keep his diet on track in his new sport.</p><p>“You’re not doing all those stupid things in the final week. You’ll train for ten or 11 weeks, for a fight, train your arse off and then in that last week you’ll ruin everything by dehydrating so badly that you can’t even think straight,” he continued.</p><p>In fact, Tyler Tyler recalled feeling “two seconds behind” during the warm-up for his final bout because of his weight loss exertions.</p><p>“I went out there and I just got pummelled, I was like a punchbag basically, and after that fight I was like, ‘I’m done with this. I’ve got to move up otherwise I’ll kill myself’,” he added.</p><p>And, despite the violent, and often bloody, nature of bare knuckle scraps, Tyler claimed that he also felt safer inside the ring than when he had been sparring with gloves.</p><p>“With bare knuckle, facially obviously the injuries are a lot worse, but I actually think it’s safer than boxing because you’re just not taking the shots that you would for a prolonged amount of time,” he explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>“People who have sort of had bleeds on the brain and things like that have been from ten or 12 round fights where they’ve taken a lot of punishment.</p><p>“Whereas bare knuckle is five two-minute rounds, and let’s face it, if you get caught clean, you’re getting knocked out.</p><p>“So I argue with people all the time; bare knuckle is safer than gloved boxing.”</p><p>On the same podcast episode, Tyler also opened up about the personal issues he had battled while striving to perform as a professional athlete, admitting that a <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>‘sex addiciton’</a> had resulted in him making a brief stint as a porn star.</p><p><b id=docs-internal-guid-d228274a-7fff-1f8c-636e-506826fb28fa><b><i>To get more sport stories from Daily Star delivered straight to your inbox sign up to one of our free newsletters </i></b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section><b><i><u>here</u></i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26479991><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Tyson Fury pays himself 'modest' £70,000 salary despite massive net worth" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26479991><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26483917.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Bare-knuckle-fighter-was-ping-blood-to-lose-weight-when-he-quit-boxing.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26369087.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Tyson-Fury-Interview-Park-Plaza-Waterloo.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26479991>Tyson Fury pays himself 'modest' £70,000 salary despite massive net worth</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26470584><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Bare-knuckle cage fighter sparks defenceless rival out with sickening kick to face" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26470584><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26483938.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Bare-knuckle-fighter-was-ping-blood-to-lose-weight-when-he-quit-boxing.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26470559.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_STARKICK.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26470584>Bare-knuckle cage fighter sparks defenceless rival out with sickening kick to face</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8GaqZ5lm6PCpLfLnmSfoZedwaa%2BjKmgp59dl7mwu8NmaW9saGh9eoM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
