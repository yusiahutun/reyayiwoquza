"In that moment where I found out about everything, I felt like the whole world was just spinning, like everything was just flipped upside down and it was this awful nightmare."</p><p>She captures this sentiment vividly in the song, painting&nbsp;a stark picture of her perspective amidst the pain—speaking&nbsp;of broken vows, feeling worthless&nbsp;and like the world around her was falling to pieces. "Tell me I'm making this up / That this ain't for real / Take me back to the night I could feel / Like I was enough / When love was just blind / I'm not ready for the truth to see the light / Make it up / Make it pretty / I don't mind / Tell me beautiful lies," she sings emotionally.</p><p>Though the two separated in 2016 after Caussin confirmed his infidelity and went to rehab, they&nbsp;<a href=#>reunited</a> in 2017 and have been on the road to a stronger marriage. The couple is no holds barred about the subject on Kramer's&nbsp;podcast, Whine Down.</p><p>"Beautiful Lies" also serves as a preview of Kramer's&nbsp;new direction for her music, which&nbsp;she&nbsp; is striving to make honest and vulnerable.&nbsp;“With the songs I’m going to release later this year, I want to tell the story from the break to healing," she says.&nbsp;“I can look back now, and [to] know how far we’ve come is amazing. To be able to release these songs this year and to show the growth is the cherry on top. It just fills my heart knowing how hard we’ve worked and how far we’ve come.”</p><p>Kramer gave brith to son <a href=#>Jace</a> in late 2018; the baby is brother to the couple's 3-year-old daughter Jolie Rae.</p><p><strong>See 18 Country Singers and the Famous Celebrities They Dated:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5melnqsvsCmnKurXZeyosHTop2upF2htqa%2FjKKln6GUmrmqwNho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
