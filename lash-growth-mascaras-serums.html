Even if you don’t crave length and volume comparable to what you’d get from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lash extensions</a>, there’s just something about thicker and healthier lashes that make the face look youthful, vibrant, and, well, pretty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not naturally blessed with a robust set of lashes, you may have already looked into methods for making them longer. Beyond temporary solutions like extensions and falsies, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair growth supplements</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lash growth serums</a> can go a long way towards increasing your lashes’ volume. But did you know that there are some mascara formulas that can actually promote lash growth? We consider these a two-for-one makeup moment: They enhance your beauty by building out your lashes instantly and over time, so long as you use them regularly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, this is a very niche beauty category, with limited options available on the market — and if you’re looking for a budget-friendly pick, you’re up for an even bigger challenge. Still, we’ve found a top-notch selection (a drugstore buy included!) by scouring the web, putting the formulas to the test, and consulting with lash experts for their recommendations. In the end, we were thoroughly impressed with nine lash growth mascaras that truly make our lashes plush and full.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-kosas-the-big-clean-volumizing--lash-care-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kosas The Big Clean Volumizing + Lash Care Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kosas The Big Clean Volumizing + Lash Care Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f1QiN65XOm9Bb1KW2ldeCDI9r7s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kosas-The-Big-Clean-Volumizing--Lash-Care-Mascara-736fdcf2db6e48daa042c8d66653acf7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Credo Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of all the formulas we tested, we felt this one yielded the most impressive results. That’s due to the fact that it delivers well-rounded benefits. Instead of just offering length or volume, The Big Clean provides both while curling and making lashes look denser. The combination of all of these benefits in one formula means that in just one coat, it appears like we’re wearing a set of ultra-plush, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high-quality falsies</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We can’t give credit solely to the formula — which contains lash-promoting castor oil, conditioning vitamin B, and thickening peptides — though. The bristled brush plays a big role. Its gently curved shape grabs every last lash and pulls them up for significant lift and a tighter curl, eliminating the need for an eyelash curler. The only aspect we don’t love about this formula is that it features a floral, almost rose-like fragrance that is a bit potent upon opening the tube, though we can’t smell it once it’s slicked on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, volumizes, curls, and boosts density｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Castor seed oil, vitamin B5, biotinoyl tripeptide-1｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-rimmel-lash-accelerator-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rimmel Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YwO8Pg97fi5Zv-6_5fzoIV_Xt5A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rimmel-lash-accelerator-mascara-597be79c04874c04be55a9151ca7cc45.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may have noticed that this is the only formula below $20 on our list.&nbsp;Lash growth mascaras are hard to find — regardless of price — yet this budget-friendly pick turned out to be one of our favorites. The bristled brush features a slightly bowed-out shape that makes creating volume and length easy, whether you want to apply just one layer or multiple coats.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Infused with lash-boosting castor seed oil, fortifying vitamin B5, and a proprietary complex known as Procapil (which uses biotinoyl tripeptide-1 and a selection of plant extracts to support lash growth with regular use), the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>affordable mascara</a> strengthens lashes over time. However, if you’re someone who prefers to check out products in person before purchasing, note that this formula can be hard to find at a local drugstore, so it’ll be easier to just shop it online.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, volumizes｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Castor seed oil, vitamin B5, Procapil｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strengthening-wander-beauty-upgraded-lashes-treatment-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strengthening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wander Beauty Treatment Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wander Beauty Upgraded Lashes Treatment Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YMJ4eCVL2DfTwesTn2LH0go1AQk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/upgraded-lashes-treatment-mascara--11fc0b83e8fb4591996fad71b06f5ac3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This formula doesn’t build easily, so if you like adding multiple coats to achieve a thicker look, you shouldn’t expect a very dramatic outcome.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is one of the first lash-boosting mascaras we ever tried and remains one of our all-time favorites —&nbsp;and it’s one of professional makeup artist, Natalia Thomas’, favorites too. “It has a molded brush, so the formula doesn’t get too thick on the applicator,” she says. This lightly sculpted hourglass shape with superfine bristles grabs even the tiniest lashes to create a delicate, fluffy look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, this formula is best used for a more natural and flirty aesthetic, so if you are trying to build up layer after layer, you may just see more of the same. That said, we do enjoy using it as a “base coat” of sorts for bolder looks, giving lashes a nourishing foundation beneath standard <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>volumizing mascaras</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Volumizes, lengthens｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Castor seed oil, provitamin B5｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-volumizing-grande-cosmetics-grandedrama-intense-thickening-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Volumizing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Grande Cosmetics Intense Thickening Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Grande Cosmetics GrandeDRAMA Intense Thickening Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lgVqAgV1KUPD0JX6VnrQomQ2jVY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/grande-cosmetics-grandedrama-intense-thickening-mascara-6471aded955e4e6ba2b1ba131ce1f3de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Grande Cosmetics is known for its lash-lengthening and strengthening formulas, and while this product isn’t infused with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brand’s signature serum</a>, it does contain castor seed oil, an ingredient recognized for its growth-promoting properties.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re fans of the hourglass-like bristled brush —&nbsp;it’s one of our favorite styles for building volume, and it certainly does when paired with this mascara formula. After one or two coats, lashes look full and voluminous, (not dry or spidery) while being so lengthy that they occasionally get stuck on our eyebrows (!). The only persnickety complaint we have is about the tube, which is the widest we’ve ever seen for a mascara. Keep this in mind if you already struggle with a bulky makeup bag.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Volumizes, lengthens, boosts density｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Castor seed oil, rice bran wax, sunflower seed wax｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curling-gxve-by-gwen-stefani-cant-stop-staring-clean-lengthening--lifting-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curling</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gxve by Gwen Stefani Lengthening & Lifting Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gxve by Gwen Stefani Can&amp;rsquo;t Stop Staring Clean Lengthening &amp;amp; Lifting Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i_3asCm2vN_yvzO60sndjG7-XFk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gxve-by-gwen-stefani-cant-stop-staring-clean-lengthening-lifting-mascara-3feadfafe2e847e097170fa64a581df4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mascara from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gwen Stefani’s makeup line</a> has been receiving a great deal of hype —&nbsp;and it’s actually worthy. The formula doesn’t dry stiff (a pet peeve of ours), but rather leaves lashes feeling soft, flexible, and natural while creating a doe-eyed look. This is due to the castor and argan oil-infused formula, which actually conditions lashes with wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The molded brush also plays a big role in the end results. Unlike any we’ve seen before, it’s designed to separate lashes, pull the formula through without clumping, and add weightless length, volume, and curl — which it does beautifully. The precise tip of the brush is perfect for detail work, like coating tiny inner and bottom lashes, but be sure to give it a quick wipe with a paper towel first —&nbsp;the unique spherical shape can hold a lot of product, and you don’t want to overload your lashes with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Curls, lengthens, separates｜<strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Castor seed oil, argan oil, vitamin B｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lengthening-thrive-causemetics-liquid-lash-extensions-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lengthening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/e_r5O6veQmD5gojedZGsOp9tMt4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thrive-causemetics-liquid-lash-extensions-mascara-fff565cd9bca4059867e7a8df989ba09.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thrive Causemetics</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve never tried a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tubing formula</a> before, you’re in for a treat —&nbsp;this award-winning product comes in three shades (including a unique gray-blue) and has tens of thousands of positive reviews. Basically, the formula contains polymers that create a tiny tube around the lashes to make them look very long, but won’t budge until you take it off with warm water (you won’t even need cleanser). The molded brush enhances the formula and easily coats lashes in a single swipe, allowing them to reach new lengths (don’t be surprised if they touch your eyebrows!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your lashes grow downwards, you may not have the best experience with this, though. The formula is a bit heavier than other mascaras we’re used to which makes it hard for our lashes to hold a curl, but they do stay soft!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, separates｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Castor seed oil, vitamin B5, hyaluronic acid｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-defining-freck-beauty-lashrocket-mascara-with-lash-enhancing-peptides></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Defining</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Freck Beauty Lashrocket Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Freck Beauty Lashrocket Mascara with Lash Enhancing Peptides" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0Y5cLJYJTGIuWLAYyFvCDhER7oY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/freckbeauty-3efa0bf12f054ec489defcf5fe703749.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While Freck Beauty may be best known for its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>faux freckle potion</a>, this mascara should be on your radar, too. The hefty, luxe tube stashes a matte black formula that combines vitamin B5 and red clover extract with biotinoyl tripeptide-1 to help beef up lashes with volume, strength, length, and fullness. The brush features short, fine bristles that allow you to get very close to the lash line with every stroke, while staving off clumps or a chunky-looking lash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because this brush creates a more feathery and subtle look, it’s best for those who prefer a more natural lash — you won’t get dramatic, falsie-worthy fringe with this.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, adds definition｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Biotinoyl tripeptide-1, vitamin B5, red clover extract｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-waterproof-urban-decay-perversion-waterproof-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Waterproof</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Urban Decay Perversion Waterproof Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Urban Decay Perversion Waterproof Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BIWBnJypX3QovZ0cP8fjw3UiBW4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/urban-decay-perversion-waterproof-mascara-6a69afe12d0a4b2587483d3d68105db9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Urban Decay</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your eyes are prone to tearing or you expect a weepy kind of day, this waterproof iteration of Urban Decay’s bestselling Perversion will be your savior.

While the whole point of using a waterproof mascara is so your lash look will last throughout a long day, regardless of the sweaty or teary circumstances, this product may in fact be too durable — you’ll need to use a very potent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup remover</a> to break it down and wash it away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, separates, volumizes｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Marine collagen, honey extract｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-ophthalmologist-tested-twentytwenty-clean-sweep-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Ophthalmologist-Tested</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Twenty/Twenty Clean Sweep Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Twenty/Twenty Clean Sweep Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rBMnL2bgtsIMxmcmzWQBVJ28oc4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/twentytwenty-clean-sweep-mascara-b6588dc270b84d8e9ed57993625941f3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Twenty/Twenty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Through this brand’s founder, board-certified ophthalmologist Dr. Diane Hilal-Campo, we learned that many makeup formulas can actually be damaging to the eye. This mascara was designed to help support eye health while keeping all eyes comfy (including those with sensitive eyes or allergies). It promotes healthy growth with strengthening biotin, hydrating hyaluronic acid, and nourishing vitamin E. Plus, it features a slightly curved bristle brush so you can swipe all your lashes in one stroke to create a very natural, everyday look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only detractor with this formula is that it is strikingly hard to remove for a non-waterproof mascara, especially if you use water-based <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eye makeup remover</a> — this one will require an oil-based formula to fully cleanse the eye area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, adds definition｜<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Biotin, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E｜<strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wand&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re already a mascara user, you know that there are really only two options out there when it comes to wands: Brushes with molded or regular bristles. The molded ones are often made of materials like plastic or silicone. Depending on the custom shape, they may look like a fairly standard brush, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara</a>, or a medieval device designed to force your lashes into submission thanks to little add-ons, like the spherical spiked tip at the end of the wand inside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gxve by Gwen Stefani Can’t Stop Staring Clean Lengthening & Lifting Mascara</a>. Traditional bristles are the type of wands that are most recognizable and are typically made using twisted wire to create a brush effect (like the one that comes with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Grande Cosmetics GrandeDRAMA Intense Thickening Mascara</a>).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Truthfully, there’s no “better” wand between the two options. “I really find that that’s a matter of preference,” says Thomas. “It’s up to the user whether they prefer a brush that carries more product or helps them to define and separate better.” Traditional wands tend to hold a lot more mascara than molded brushes as there are more nooks and crannies between wire bristles for the formula to get into —&nbsp;this means you’ll be able to load on some significant pigment for a more bolder look with boosted volume. Molded brushes, especially those that have spiky tips, are helpful for creating separation and definition, says Thomas.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formula</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When seeking out a lash growth mascara, the formula is everything — it needs to be infused with active ingredients that were selected specifically for their ability to promote longer, thicker lashes, while helping to strengthen and condition the lashes you already have. “Choose products that contain lash-nourishing ingredients, like keratin, panthenol (vitamin B5), and plant extracts such as red clover extract, and amino acids,” recommends Vincent. These ingredients will help strengthen your lashes, making it easier for them to grow more healthily and thus, longer. For our list, we selected mascaras that exclusively have ingredients like these in their formulas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of our favorite plant extracts to look for in lash growth formulas is castor seed oil. Many people use this natural ingredient as a homeopathic remedy, applying it to their lashes, brows, and scalps to help stimulate hair growth. There’s something to it, though —&nbsp;ricinoleic acid is one of the most concentrated fatty acids found in castor seed oil, and it’s been proven to have an effect on hair growth. Remember, the key to seeing success from lash growth formulas is using them every day. That’s why we like the idea of mascara infused with ingredients that support lash growth —&nbsp;it’s easy for us to remember to use our mascara!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are someone that prefers a waterproof formula, we recommend only using it sporadically and applying one that has lash growth properties like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Urban Decay Perversion Waterproof Mascara</a>. “Most waterproof formulas have formaldehyde, and even if they do not contain this ingredient, they are especially difficult to remove — the friction of removal causes your lashes to fall out more readily,” warns Thomas.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What helps your eyelashes grow?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Treating your eyelashes gently and with care will go a long way towards supporting healthy growth. Often, it’s certain behaviors that are inhibiting your lashes from getting lengthy. “External factors include damage from rubbing too harshly when removing eye makeup, reaction to mascaras or eyeliners, or irritation from lash extensions,” says Dani Kimiko Vincent, professional makeup artist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kimiko</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your makeup technique can also play a role. For example, you should never curl lashes once you’ve already applied mascara. “This can tear out lashes when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the curler</a> is opened and is damaging, so ensure you’re only curling bare lashes,” Vincent adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, consider how you sleep. Of course, you’ll be going to bed after fully removing your makeup (right?), but sleeping on your face can wreak havoc on your lashes. “If you are a face sleeper, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silk pillowcase</a> can be especially helpful for retaining moisture in your skin and hair,” recommends Thomas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond using mascaras with nourishing ingredients and avoiding bad behaviors, you can supplement your diet with nutrients that facilitate hair growth. Some to look for are biotin (found in eggs), fatty acids (in oily fish, like salmon), and vitamin B (in nuts and seeds). You can also go the supplement route. Brittany Lo, professional makeup artist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Beia</a>, recommends seeking out prenatal vitamins, while Vincent likes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Nutrafol</a>. Just be sure to ask your doctor before incorporating anything new into your diet, supplements included.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, incorporating lash serums or mascaras with strengthening and conditioning ingredients can also make a difference. Any of the mascaras on our list will enhance lashes with continued use, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Kosas The Big Clean Mascara</a> really stands out for its mix of lash-promoting castor oil, conditioning vitamin B, and thickening peptides.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can mascara affect lash growth?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not directly, per se. “Mascara in and of itself does not affect lash growth, but not fully removing it or being harsh when removing can,” says Vincent, who (like Thomas) advises against regular use of waterproof mascara as rubbing your lashes to cleanse them can adversely affect lash fullness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you struggle with your mascara smudging and you lean towards using a waterproof mascara, try switching to a tubing mascara, which can be simply removed with warm water,” suggests Vincent. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara</a> is a solid example of this — regular use of a tubing mascara will help them recover from waterproof mascara. When you use traditional mascara formulas, including waterproof, Lo recommends using a bi-phase makeup remover, which contains oil to help break down durable formulas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to keep your lash routine hygienic. Eye infections can inhibit lash growth, and a beauty routine can get pretty filthy if you’re not paying attention. “Make sure you are replacing your mascara every couple of months to ensure you're not using a tube infected with bacteria,” warns Lo. We recommend labeling your mascara with the date you started using it —&nbsp;this way, you can keep track of how long it’s been on rotation and when you should ditch it for a new, clean tube.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the healthiest mascara for your eyelashes?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we fully endorse the mascaras on this list, which are formulated with ingredients to support healthy and happy lashes (so long as you’re taking them off every night!), taking a break from mascara will really help your lashes get stronger. “Try opting for a lash lift and tint which curls your lashes at the root and tints them darker so that you can skip the mascara altogether,” suggests Thomas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can also just give them a chance to breathe. “When your lashes are feeling weak, I suggest using a darker liner, curling the lashes, and foregoing mascara unless it's necessary,” Lo says.
