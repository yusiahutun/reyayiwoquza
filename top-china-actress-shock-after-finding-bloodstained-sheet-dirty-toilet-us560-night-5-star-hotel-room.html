I was stunned by her response. Was that a sincere apology?” Tian said. “Are people who can afford to stay in such a hotel really interested in a gratis afternoon tea?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We guests expect a hotel to make us feel safe and comfortable. The bedsheets and toilets should be clean. Does the current sanitary condition match its five-star status?” she asked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tian told a similar story of dissatisfaction when she asked to send her friend to send items by courier to the same hotel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her friend asked a courier to leave a package at the reception desk, but when Tian went to collect it there were no members of staff around and she waited half an hour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Tian complained again, a different employee accused her of making the blood stains on the sheet herself in an attempt to wangle a complimentary stay at the hotel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve travelled around and stayed in hotels for many years. Would I do this just for a free room stay?” the actress asked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve stayed in plenty of five-star hotels and none of them have had issues like this,” she added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 42-year-old is an actress, producer and writer in China, whose husband Wang Shi is the founder of the country’s largest property development company, Vanke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/02/1b35e4f9-f07f-4048-9d78-8e75f5df9f4f_b0eeec7b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Tian did not mention the name of the hotel, online observers speculated it was the Rosewood in Guangzhou, and the hotel confirmed the incident happened at its premises, according to mainland media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are carrying out an internal investigation and are liaising with this guest,” a spokesperson said. “We are aware of the problem and will definitely make adjustments.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTBs7HNnaCnn12Ytaq6wGiYq6yZmLmme5JrbGluZW58tbvPZpqhoZ6WeqKv06ucrKtdqLWwr8pmmJ%2Bslad6p7XNnaCnn12XubC7w6yrmqGemrFuv8eenK1llJ6%2FtcWMraaipJWpera%2FlG9nZqaZnLW1eZRmqq2ZomK1sMDEpWSrp5%2Bi</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
