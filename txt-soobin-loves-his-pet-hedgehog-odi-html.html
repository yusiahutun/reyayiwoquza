In 2021, the <a href=#>TXT</a> member revealed that he got a hedgehog named Odi that lives in the <a href=#>K-pop group</a>‘s dorm. In a recent interview with Weverse Magazine, <a href=#>Soobin</a> shared how much he loves taking care of Odi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TXT-Soobin.jpg><h2 id=h-soobin-of-txt-has-a-hedgehog-named-odi>Soobin of TXT has a hedgehog named Odi</h2><p id=par-2_25>In April 2021, Soobin got a pet hedgehog named Odi. The hedgehog lives in TXT’s dorm with Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and <a href=#>Huening Kai</a>.</p><p id=par-3_42>Soobin revealed to MOA that he got Odi in June 2021, and he frequently posts updates about his pet on social media. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Weverse Magazine</a>, Soobin revealed more details about what it is like having Odi as a pet.</p><p id=par-4_63>“I tried to give him different kinds of snacks for a change of pace but he won’t eat anything other than mealworms. I’m just going to give him mealworms like always. (laughs) When I look at YouTubers, their hedgehogs are so gentle and are okay when you pet them, but Odi doesn’t really like people unless they give him mealworms. (laughs),” Soobin shared.</p><p id=par-5_50>He continued, “But now he comes out from his shelter sometimes and doesn’t run away when I turn on the lights. He doesn’t like when you touch his back, but he’s okay with his stomach, so I pet his belly like this. I love how warm and soft it feels.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 id=h-why-soobin-likes-having-odi-as-a-pet>Why Soobin likes having Odi as a pet</h2><p id=par-6_25>Speaking with Weverse Magazine, Soobin shared that having Odi has given variety to his routine, and he also feels that Odi brightens his day.</p><p id=par-7_84>“Before I got Odi, every day was exactly the same: practice, go home, sleep. I even always saw the same people, so the days were becoming boring. Having Odi has given me a lot I have to do, and after I come home I watch him and play with his feet before going to bed, which has become a daily routine. I’m just grateful and happy he’s there waiting for me. I have a lot more small things to be happy about,” Soobin shared.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-what-else-does-soobin-enjoy-in-his-free-time>What else does Soobin enjoy in his free time?</h2><p id=par-8_27>In addition to spending time with Odi, Soobin also shared how he likes to spend his free time when not working as a member of TXT.</p><p id=par-9_71>“I don’t game lately, but I do watch anime. I just watched one recently, in fact, so I’ve been talking with HUENINGKAI nonstop for two days about it. When you watch anime, you need someone who can share your feelings. I think I can talk about it a lot thanks to Huening. Actually, whenever I recommend something to him, he says he’s already seen it all. (laughs),” Soobin told Weverse Magazine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBucCMrKaompmjeq271Z6qZqCZqHqxsdNmn56cl5q1sLOMqJuiZpipuq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
