Amazon currently has the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Blink Outdoor 4th Generation 5-Camera Security System</a> for half off, costing only $199.99. The only catch is that you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of this dealâ€”but if you've signed up for Prime to take advantage of one of the company's many Prime-only sales events, this is a non-issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We name a Blink camera (specifically, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Blink Mini</a>) as our <a href=#>best security camera</a> overall, and generally, we have no complaints about the Amazon company's security, unlike other companies, <a href=#>such as Wyze</a>. So whether you're looking to replace some older cameras or are starting fresh, this is a great purchase. While a camera system may not be the same as a fully-fledged <a href=#>security system</a>, a bundle like this gives you a lot of control over your home security, and generally integrates well with smart home ecosystems like Alexa and Google Home.</p><p>With five Blink Outdoor cameras, you'll be able to cover every nook and cranny of your home, ensuring it's safe from intruders and wildlife alike. These cameras also come with infrared night vision and 2-way audio, so you can be certain of who (or what) is near your home and scare them away with your voice. You'll also get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Blink Sync Module 2</a>, which is used in conjunction with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blink Home Monitor app</a> to make it easy to check your cameras, and even link them with indoor Blink cameras and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Blink Video Doorbell</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You'll also get a 30-day trial of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Blink Plus Subscription Plan</a>. With the subscription, you can get video recording for all five of your Blink Outdoor cameras, Person Detection, and other perks. If you're not keen on paying a subscription, however, you can save recording data locally with the Sync Module 2 and a <a href=#>USB drive</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blink-outdoor-5-pack.png><h5 class=display-card-title>Blink Outdoor 4 (4th Gen) 5-Camera System</h5>$199.99 <span class=regular-price>$399.99</span> Save $200<p class=display-card-description>If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can pick up the Blink Outdoor 4 pack for half off right now!</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$199.99 at Amazon</a><p>If you're looking for more Blink deals, you can opt for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Blink Outdoor 4 2-Camera Pack</a> instead, which comes with one free year of the Blink Subscription Plus plan.
