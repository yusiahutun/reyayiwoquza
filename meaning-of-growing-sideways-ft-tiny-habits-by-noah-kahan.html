Tiny Habits by Noah Kahan</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>The Noah Kahan song titled "Growing Sideways Ft. Tiny Habits" is a poignant and introspective track that delves into the complexities of navigating through life's ups and downs. The overall theme of the song revolves around the idea of finding solace in detachment and avoidance, as a means of coping with overwhelming emotions. It captures the struggles of trying to suppress or ignore feelings in order to protect oneself from pain.One standout lyric in the song is, "Yeah, it's better to die numb than feel it all." This line encapsulates the underlying theme of emotional detachment and the notion of choosing numbness as a defense mechanism. It speaks to the idea of shutting oneself off from intense emotions to avoid the vulnerability that comes with experiencing pain or loss. This perspective provides an interesting viewpoint on the nature of pain and how individuals sometimes resort to extreme measures to protect themselves.Another notable lyric is, "But I ignore things and I move sideways, until I forget what I felt in the first place." This lyric explores the concept of escapism and avoidance. It suggests that rather than confronting difficult emotions head-on, the protagonist of the song chooses to sidestep them, hoping that they will eventually fade away. This theme of running away from emotions ties back to the overall idea of finding alternative ways to cope with the overwhelming nature of human emotions.Building on this concept, the song suggests that forgetting what one felt in the first place is a potential coping mechanism. While it may seem counterintuitive, this lyric highlights the artist's realization that sometimes it is easier to let go of emotions entirely, rather than grappling with their intensity. It introduces the idea that forgetting can be a form of self-protection and self-preservation, as it allows individuals to detach from the pain associated with past experiences.Furthermore, the line, "At the end of the day, Lord knows there are worse ways to stay alive," reflects a bittersweet acknowledgment of the various ways people cope with life's hardships. It suggests that while detaching oneself may not be the ideal or healthiest approach, it is still a viable option to stay afloat amidst the challenges life presents. This lyric highlights the theme of acceptance and understanding that individuals navigate life in different ways, even if they may not align with conventional norms.In a larger sense, the song explores the internal battles individuals face when trying to reconcile their emotions with the complexities of the world. It touches upon the universal struggles of coping with pain, loss, and the overwhelming nature of human existence. By delving into the theme of emotional detachment, the lyrics provide an unexpected perspective on the human condition and the lengths people may go to find a sense of peace within themselves.Overall, "Growing Sideways Ft. Tiny Habits" presents a deeply introspective journey through the web of human emotions. Through its poignant lyrics, the song invites listeners to contemplate the ways in which people cope with life's challenges and the different paths they take to navigate through the complexities of their own feelings. From the choice of emotional detachment to the embrace of forgetting, the song's themes ultimately remind us of the multifaceted nature of the human experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyvu8ChZKSZmJa7cLnEmqWippdivKd5xqumsKGenHq0tcOerpqxo2KztXnToqWyZZiWr6rA0maZsmWepK6pecqan5qm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
