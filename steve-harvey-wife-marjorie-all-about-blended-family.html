Marriage is fine,"</strong> adding: "I don't know what y'all are doin', but find something else to do cause we fine, Lord have mercy."</p><p id=e0EwGkLCwvr data-wc=55>Marjorie followed suit with her own post on Instagram where she wrote: "My husband and I don't usually stop to address all the foolishness and lies that have been spread about us," noting: "I understand that with my platform comes some sort of responsibility to those that may not be as strong as we are."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Steve Harvey unveils new look without famous mustache</figure><p id=eJs4VI_STR4 data-wc=24>Clearly, Steve and Marjorie have maintained a loving, steady relationship since tying the knot in 2007, and you can read all about it below.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Who is Steve Harvey's wife?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=e5hbgHfl44q data-wc=37>Marjorie Harvey (née Bridges), 59, is Steve's third wife.

Marjorie immediately caught her future husband's eye, and during an appearance on his eponymous show in 2018, she recalled: <strong>"He was just staring at me… He finally realized, 'Oh, I gotta say something.' He was, like, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know who this is, but I'm gonna marry her.'"</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c9756142255d-steve-harvey-kids-famous-family.jpg><p id=e_tw9wUpHGf data-wc=30>They briefly dated but it fizzled out.

In 2016, he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>: "He told me, 'Look, the only time I've ever seen you happy was when you were with that woman Marjorie. Now, before you go and do something stupid and marry another woman, I'm calling her.'"</p><p id=e85lMCFtEaln data-wc=39>It was undoubtedly the right decision, and he also told the outlet: "Marjorie changed the way I existed." He recalled: <strong>"It was like being reborn. I messed up so many times in my life. She made all the difference."</strong></p><p id=es8QeO7SvmAH data-wc=26>The two tied the knot on June 25, 2007, and earlier this summer, they celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary with a trip to Lake Como, Italy.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Who are Steve Harvey's kids?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/012d10203bee-gettyimages-168676883.jpg><p id=ec5G8tWz_3h7 data-wc=39>Steve and Marjorie have a blended family of seven.
