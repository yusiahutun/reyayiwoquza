And when social trust collapses, nations fail.”</p>While people such as Brooks take a longer historical sweep, Edelman’s annual survey allows a more granular examination of the forces at work. And for the past year, the combined impact of the pandemic, Trump and perfidious forces of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">social media</span></a> have been little short of catastrophic.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Governments that earned brownie points early in the year for their efforts to wrestle with Covid-19 saw a sharp collapse in public trust as the pandemic killed more people, ruined more jobs, and showed no sign of coming under control.</p>By Edelman’s measure, trust in governments across 27 countries rose from 55 points in January to a peak of 61 in May, and then collapsed back to 56 today. Trust slumped by 17 points in South Korea between May and the end of the year, and by 15 points in the UK – though <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">muddles over Brexit</span></a> may have contributed to that. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/01/14/trump_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:48</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">US House impeaches Trump for inciting deadly Capitol attack</p><p>US House impeaches Trump for inciting deadly Capitol attack</p>In the US, trust in government collapsed much more sharply among Trump voters, compared to Biden voters – a reality spectacularly illustrated by the <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">January 6 assault</span></a> on the US Capitol building in Washington, and by persistent <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Trump-inspired organisations</span></a> that continue to claim government fraud not just in Washington, but in state capitals across the country.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most fascinating, trust among Chinese in their government, which sat at an improbable 82 points at the end of 2019, has fallen by 10 points. If President Xi Jinping ever bothers to take note of such research, he cannot be amused.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the four institutions tracked by Edelman – government, business, NGOs and the media – only businesses are seen as both ethical and competent. Trust in NGOs and the media – the latter badly tainted by the fact-free polarisation that has occurred among social media cocoons – has declined sharply.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Trust Barometer also shows a rapidly widening divergence between levels of trust among the “informed public” – those with university degrees, high household incomes and significant engagement in public policy – and the general population, a force that is undermining trust in the elite, and even “experts”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Are anti-vaxxers winning as India, Indonesia press on with inoculations?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Edelman also found lower trust levels among those with “poor information hygiene”: people who do not “engage” with news, people who unquestioningly subsist inside social media echo chambers, who fail to verify information, and who pass on unvetted information.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An alarming 60 per cent of respondents thought news organisations were more concerned with supporting an ideology than with informing the public. The implications here for political polarisation and populism are clear.</p>For us here in Hong Kong, the pregnant question is what has happened to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">trust</span></a>. Yes, trust levels must surely have crashed, yet I am still shocked when I revisit Hong Kong’s performance in the 2019 Trust Barometer. Trust levels in Hong Kong then had surged by about 10 points compared to the previous year – more than any other economy surveyed.Trust among under-24-year-olds was <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">higher</span></a> than for any other age group. When asked “whether my government is failing me”, just 23 per cent of Hong Kong survey respondents said yes – far lower even than patriotic Singapore. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/12/07/full_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">07:30</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China’s Rebel City: The Hong Kong Protests</p><p>China’s Rebel City: The Hong Kong Protests</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is almost embarrassing to ask how the survey could have found such exceptionally optimistic survey results, just months before the city fell into the most traumatic and sustained period of social unrest seen in 50 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the time, Edelman researchers credited the positive mood to a recent rapid rise in household incomes, unemployment at a record low of 2.8 per cent and falling crime levels. The survey results profoundly failed to catch any hint of the horrors that Hong Kong was to experience just months later.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clearly, the Trust Barometer needs to address how it missed the dark forces that we now know were then at work. We also need to pay especial attention to the obvious collapse of trust that has occurred since.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/01/22/thumbnail_web_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">06:15</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">BN(O) passport holders flee Hong Kong for new life in the UK, fearing Beijing’s tightening control</p><p>BN(O) passport holders flee Hong Kong for new life in the UK, fearing Beijing’s tightening control</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tantalisingly, Edelman cannot at this point clarify. A special briefing on Hong Kong findings is awaited in March. I and many others will be fascinated to pour over the findings and their predictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Brooks wrote: “When people in a society lose faith or trust in their institutions and in each other, the nation collapses.” They become a “broken, alienated society caught in a distrust doom loop”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether Hong Kong has already fallen into such a “distrust doom loop” is moot. Edelman’s special March briefing on Hong Kong must shed some light.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">David Dodwell researches and writes about global, regional and Hong Kong challenges from a Hong Kong point of view</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGhqcWZtfnDA0a6qrWWcmsOmuNJmmKudXaW5trnMnquippdirqS%2BzqyqZqiRo7GmucicZKuZppa0prCMsKarpJRixKmt0w%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
