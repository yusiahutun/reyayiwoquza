Even so, there is no sign on his studio in central Seoul.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Umbrella, goggles, flag: tattoos used as symbols of Hong Kong protest</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“On your way back home after tattooing Brad Pitt, there are no words to describe how proud you feel,” says the 40-year-old. “But from the moment you arrive at Incheon International Airport, you worry about the tattoo tools in your bag being found.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Doy, whose real name is Kim Do-yoon, says the situation leaves the country’s 20,000-odd tattooists vulnerable to prosecution and random raids – as well as blackmail by malicious or dissatisfied clients.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier this year, he established the country’s first tattoo artists’ union and will soon ask the Constitutional Court to legalise tattooing by non-doctors. But after media reports featuring his union activities, someone – who has not been publicly identified – filed a criminal complaint and Doy now faces a police inquiry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/11/3a5f7d8e-f2fd-11ea-8f3b-07283e3f3bd8_972x_211655.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It “feels c*****” to be investigated, he says, but felt he “had to do something”. “If you leave things as they are, nothing will change,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the Korea Tattoo Association – a separate organisation to Doy’s union – at least a million people have inked their skin in the country and the illicit, but growing, industry is worth about 200 billion won (US$170 million) a year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It says another 200,000 beauticians who apply permanent make-up to their clients using tattooing techniques also come under the current rules. But despite their new-found popularity, tattoos can still carry negative connotations, especially at workplaces in South Korea, with public broadcasters often blurring them out.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I’ve always felt uneasy about doing something illegal, and I still feel uneasy. But this is the only thing that I’m good at. I accepted that when I was convicted the first timeSouth Korean tattooist Kim Goang-seok</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Medical doctors strongly oppose legalising tattooing, saying doing so would “endanger” Koreans. Getting inked by non-doctors could lead to “a serious infection or allergic reactions”, an official at the Korea Medical Association says. Doy’s union plans to come up with health guidelines for tattooists, in collaboration with medical professionals who support their cause.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Doy has tattooed at least 10,000 people in his 14-year career, but says he had never faced prosecution or blackmail until July. Other tattooists, though, had lost their income after being convicted, and he knows of artists who have committed suicide as a result. “This is devastating,” he says. “In a way, they lost their lives because they were painting.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some have come to terms with being repeat offenders: Kim Goang-seok, 54, says that when he first went into tattooing 25 years ago, “80 per cent of my clients were gangsters, and I would repeatedly ink big tigers and dragons”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/11/39c15cb2-f2fd-11ea-8f3b-07283e3f3bd8_972x_211655.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has been convicted three times for inking and was once jailed for eight months, but says he will never stop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve always felt uneasy about doing something illegal, and I still feel uneasy,” says Kim, who has been tattooing at his “secret”, signless studio in the southern city of Ulsan for more than two decades. “But this is the only thing that I’m good at. I accepted that when I was convicted the first time.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Marked for life:South Korea’s illegal tattoo artists seek rethink on ink</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9j2pnam5fqLy2wMdmoqiqlZa7bsDArauop12Wv7W10q1ksKCfYravt8SdZJuqkZl6sbXTrWSappRiuG68zqk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
