Management To Be Presented With The Peter Grant Award At The UK Artist &amp;amp; Manager Awards</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MMF-Logo-large.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p>LONDON (CelebrityAccess) — The Music Managers Forum (MMF) and Featured Artists Coalition (FAC) announced that the Artist & Manager Awards will return to London this year on Wednesday 14th November.</p><p>The event, which is intended to recognize the UK’s artist and management community, will take place at the Bloomsbury Big Top, 93 Guildford St, where the organization will present Modest! Management with the Peter Grant Award.</p><p>The Peter Grant Award, named after the legendary Led Zeppelin manager, is awarded annually to a manager who has gained the respect of their peers over a sustained career. Previous recipients at the Artist & Manager Awards are Jonathan Kessler (2017), Peter Rudge (2016), Jim Beach (2015), Paul Loasby (2014), Terry Blamey (2012) and John Glover (2011).</p><p>Under the event’s previous incarnation as the British Music Roll of Honour, the Peter Grant Award was received by Simon Fuller (2008), Bill Curbishley (2007), Paul McGuiness (2006), David Enthoven & Tim Clark (2004), Jazz Summers (2003), Ian McAndrew & Colin Lester (2002), Chris Morrison (2001), Tony Smith (2000), Rod Smallwood (1999), Ed Bicknell (1998), Gail Colson (1997), Geoff Travis & Jeanette Lee (1996).</p><p>Founded in 2003 by Richard Griffiths and Harry Magee, Modest! work with a list of clients that includes Niall Horan, Little Mix, Olly Murs, 5 Seconds Of Summer, Katherine Jenkins, MNEK, Astrid S and Alison Moyet. As well, Modest! Management guided the careers of One Direction from 2010 to 2016, during which time they sold more than 100 million records and performed in front of 10 million (probably screaming) fans.</p><p>Along with fellow partner Will Bloomfield, the company has expanded internationally and now includes offices with offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, and ongoing interests in music publishing, recording, touring, brand partnerships, merchandise, endorsements, theatre, and television.</p><p>“Modest! are the epitome of a modern-day music management business, representing all aspects of their artists’ careers and acting for them on a global basis. Their achievements over the past 16 years have been nothing short of astonishing, and the company is wholly deserving of their Peter Grant Award, which is the ultimate honor bestowed by the MMF. We now look forward to Richard, Harry, Will and the rest of the Modest! team joining us on November 14th in what promises to be our best awards show yet,” MMF CEO Annabella Coldrick said.</p><p>“It’s been an exciting and eventful 16 years since we started Modest! Every day is different and never a dull moment! We’re so proud of all our artists – both established and new. We’re also very proud of everyone in the company who everyday share a vision and commitment to nurture, develop and maintain the talents and careers of those artists around the world. It’s a very exciting time to be moving the company forward as our industry evolves within such revolutionary times,” the Modest! team said in a statement.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoVwfJVoaGtnnaSxpr%2FTZqSappGcsq6xza1kraddl7JuvNGeqp6mpJqxbsPIrZ9mrJiaerGx056pZp%2Bilru1ecCwmKucXZbBbsDHnmSuo12Wv7W10q1kppmelrSmvoyarpqqlKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
