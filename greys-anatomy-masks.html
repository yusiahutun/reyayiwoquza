The season is set amid the current health crisis, as the doctors of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital try to keep themselves and their patients safe from you-know-what. So far, two doctors have come down the virus—Meredith Grey and Tom Koracik—but it’s expected that the health crisis will play out for the rest of the season.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Given the current time that Grey’s Anatomy season set in, the characters (and the actors) are decked out in head-to-toe personal protective equipment. This includes gloves, a surgical gown and a helmet-like face shield with a microphone that’s connected to some sort of respiratory machine. But what is the Grey’s Anatomy mask and can people who don’t work in the medical field buy one? Read on for what we know.</p><h2>What are the Grey’s Anatomy masks?</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in December 2020, Zoanne Clack, a doctor, writer and an executive producer on Grey’s Anatomy since its premiere in 2005, revealed that those helmet-like masks are real and called Powered Air Purifying Respirators (or PAPR for short.) “Those helmet-like masks are real and are called PAPR—but of course we wanted to see their faces as much as possible! “PAPR” stands for Powered Air Purifying Respirator,” she said. “In the real world, they are used when individuals have the potential to be exposed to airborne pathogens and are convenient because they don’t have to be ‘fit-tested’ like an N95 mask does.”</p><p>Clack explained that the masks not only kept the cast safe while filming, but also allowed viewers see to the actors’ faces and expressions. “I thought they did get fogged up sometimes early on but I asked someone in production and he said it was never a problem—probably because they do allow airflow in and out of them,” she said. “But we had to do a lot of figuring out about how to light them properly to prevent glare and we ended up with some kind of anti-glare material that was fitted into them.”</p><p>Fans will also notice that the PAPR masks on Grey’s Anatomy have microphones that come out from the side and hover in front of the character’s mouth. It’s unclear whether those PAPR masks came with microphones or if they were built into the costumers to record the actors’ voices better while their heads are in the helmets. As for if non-doctors can buy their own PAPR mask, there seem to be several Available on Amazon. But they’re not cheap. Many of the PAPR masks retail for upwards of $800.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$809</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$1,687.03</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>52% Off</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PAPR-Mask.jpg><p>It’s also best to leave the essential PPE equipment for frontline workers.
