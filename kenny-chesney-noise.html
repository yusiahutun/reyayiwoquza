Without being political, he takes on politics. Without sounding like&nbsp;a luddite, he challenges technology. Without smelling&nbsp;curmudgeonly, he recalls how things once were.</p><p>There’s no doubting the urgency in Chesney’s voice as he sings this country-rocker about the constant hum that bears down on us every day. Suddenly open air has become a vacuum that pulls in distractions from every corner of&nbsp;the universe. If you’ve felt guilty about not being able to put your cell phone down during dinner with your kids, Chesney’s song is going to twist that knife deeper.</p><p>“Noise” is, if nothing else, relevant. He doesn’t as much offer a solution to how to escape the cacophony around us as much as he does spend a few minutes describing it. Few would argue with his and co-writers Ross Copperman, Shane McAnally and Jon Nite’s basic premise: it’s nearly impossible to find one square-inch of perfect silence in the world, and that works to our detriment.</p><p>Perhaps lost in Chesney’s first new single from an upcoming 17th&nbsp;studio album is the progressive production. While hardly genre-bending, there’s a few effects (vocal and otherwise) that act as static, mimicking his theme on this song. Guitars come from every direction. The rhythm section isn’t as imposing as you&nbsp;find on some modern country arrangements, but it never has been for Chesney. The vocals and lyrics are never covered&nbsp;on “Noise,” a song that could signal the start of a more socially active era for one of the greats of all time.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>:&nbsp;McAnnally is been a good luck charm for Chesney. He helped write three of his most recent hits: "American Kids," "Wild Child" and "Somewhere With You."</p><p><strong>Listen to Kenny Chesney, "Noise"</strong></p><p><strong>Kenny Chesney Talks About Noise&nbsp;</strong></p><p><h3>Kenny Chesney, “Noise” Lyrics:</h3></p><p>“Wrecking balls, downtown construction / Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing/ Cardboard sign says ‘The Lord is coming’ / Tick tick tock / Rumors turn the mills back home / Parking lot kids with the speakers blown / We didn’t turn it on, but we can’t turn it off off off.”</p><p>“Sometimes I wonder how did we get here / Seems like all we ever hear is …”</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>“Noise, yeah we scream, we shout til we don’t have a voice / In the streets, in the crowds, it ain’t nothing but noise / Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy / Just trying to be heard in all this noise’ says it all.”</p><p>“Twenty four hour television / Gets so loud that no one listens / Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk / But there really ain't no conversation / Ain't nothing left to the imagination / Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop this.”</p><p>“Every room, every house, every shade of noise / All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise / We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise / We can't take the noise, so we just make …”</p><p>“Can’t tame the noise.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2eo8Zur8eeqqedqWK7sLXSnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
