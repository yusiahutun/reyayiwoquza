"I'm like, 'If we can never have any other kids, that's okay, because he's amazing.' And I have this amazing life. Like, really, what can I complain about? I can't. I have an incredible husband, incredible friends, an incredible job, an incredible kid. Can I be mad? No.</p><p>She said she'd always been afraid to be angry. But finally, "I got mad."</p><p>And so she channeled those feelings into her writing process for her music. "I feel like there's several songs on the album that came from that, you know, or I connect with in a totally different way because of those experiences that we went through," Underwood said.</p><p>According to Underwood, the single "Cry Pretty" is about how "you put this face on for the world," because that's what she was doing through so much of her pain.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f7c980b1-9c33-5e48-80a5-ccf3c116a97a data-container-ref=toofab:article:6838d6ec-be3b-53f3-ad2f-050df086f65d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=31><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/46/5by4/2018/08/31/46e6ea46d6c15733a34bd6d5cf48a211_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">14 #NewMusicFriday Songs You Gotta Hear: Eminem, Carrie Underwood, Michael Jackson, Twenty One Pilots</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I would literally have these horrible things going on in my life, and then have to go smile and, like, do some interviews or, like, do a photo shoot or something, you know?" she said. "So it was just kind of, like, therapeutic, I guess."</p><p>Finally, after fearing she'd had yet another miscarriage, Underwood turned to her faith with a sort of desperate prayer. "I was like, 'Why on Earth do I keep getting pregnant if I can't have a kid? Like, what is this? Shut the door. Like, do something. Either shut the door or let me have a kid.'</p><p>"And for the first time, I feel like I actually I told God how I felt. And I feel, like, we're supposed to do that. That was like a Saturday â€“ and the Monday I went to the doctor to, like, confirm, another miscarriage. And they told me everything was great!"</p><p>And for now, it certainly seems that way. Underwood is currently enjoying a healthy pregnancy and planning a spring tour, where her new baby will join her.</p><a id=gallery-link-14864f40-4581-5f7b-8ddb-4c7618a117ef class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:14864f40-4581-5f7b-8ddb-4c7618a117ef data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20180416_929c6c5a32b753ddb780fb204d3aa50d data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6838d6ec-be3b-53f3-ad2f-050df086f65d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/92/4by3/2018/04/16/929c6c5a32b753ddb780fb204d3aa50d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3Jmam5fmK6zvsieZK6mlJq%2FuLvOnWStoKKasm65yKyamqqinq6osdJmq7CnXa6yor7SZqernZejrq%2FAjJyZrGWjqrulrdhmpKiqnp67qHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
