Designed to help you get where you need to go in a safe and easy manner, walking canes have become an essential part of many people’s day to day. We’ve rounded up eight of the best walking aids on the market to help you integrate them into your life, as well.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Types of Walking Aids</h2><p>Before you start shopping for a walking aid, it’s important to know what’s out there. While aids may vary, there are three popular types that most people turn to for a quick mobility boost. Keep reading to learn more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Canes: </strong>When you think of a walking aid, the first thing that comes to mind is likely a cane. Designed to help you maintain your balance and act as additional support for your body, canes are the least fussy type of walking aids. They come in a variety of designs, including self-standing models that won’t fall over and foldable versions that collapse for storage. White canes, which are used by the blind and visually impaired to help fellow pedestrians identify them and scan their surroundings for obstacles, are another type of cane that serves as a mobility aid. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Crutches: </strong>Whether you’re living with a disease such as Cerebral Palsy, recently took a tumble, or finally got that knee surgery you’ve been putting off for months, a pair of crutches can be instrumental in your ability to move about. Typically used by those with severe mobility limitations in their legs or those who need assistance post-op, crutches are placed under the armpit or braced to your forearm to hold you up and help you maneuver. While many are designed to be short term walking aids, there are also crutches you can use in long term instances that will be more comfortable than your average pharmacy-grade set.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Walkers: </strong>One of the most popular walking aids we come in contact with as we age are walkers. Designed in two-, three-, and four-wheel varieties, these manual devices, which form a stable-wheeled barrier around your body, allowing you to use them for leverage to lean against or move forward, offer maximum stability with two grips to hold on to. Some models even feature a seat for much-needed breaks or baskets for storage.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Walking Aids for Seniors</h2><p>Whether you’re looking for the ultimate cane or a walker with four wheels to ensure you don’t end up on all fours, you can shop our walking aid roundup to find the perfect walking aid option for you. <strong>Keep scrolling for</strong> <strong>FIRST for Women’s</strong> <strong>pick for the best walking aids for seniors.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.
