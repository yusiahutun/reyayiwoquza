First, most recipes call for raw almonds. Have you ever tasted a raw almond before? They taste, to me, terrible, like waxy nothingness. Why stretch this waxy nothingness into a glass of liquid? However, you know that flavor you get when you deeply toast almonds to a nice milky coffee (mm, milky coffee) shade, that incredible flavor which is amazing in pastries as it is on salads and even for a plain snack? Why weren’t we making almond milk out of toasted almonds — was it just the shade? Does beige “milk” unnerve people?</p><p><a title="looking real murky the next day" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5557/14960536659_6ed9402595_z.jpg alt="looking real murky the next day" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="rinsing the nuts" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5554/14960582540_ca4847b781_z.jpg alt="rinsing the nuts" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="i admire their buoyancy" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3885/14960682287_9932cc5ab7_z.jpg alt="i admire their buoyancy" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="things get violent" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/15146851302_ff3286d8d4_z.jpg alt="things get violent" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>And then — yes, I know, there’s more — I mean, I like almonds.

I toasted hazelnuts so they were quite dark. I soaked them for most of a day in water. I blended them until as pureed as possible. I strained. I squeezed. And then I melted chocolate and whisked the toasted hazelnut milk in a little at a time. I chilled it. I poured it into tiny glasses and propped in bendy straws. And then my darling little <a href=#>kindergartener</a> arrived home from his first day at school and I said “Mama made you a chocolate snack!” and he was so excited and I poured him a glass and he said, “No. I do not like this.”</p><p><a title="this is toasted hazelnut milk. but we're not stopping here." href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5590/15147246995_249e850e0f_z.jpg alt="this is toasted hazelnut milk. but we're not stopping here." data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="chopping chocolate, but chips work too" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3869/15124225356_dffaba0fa9_z.jpg alt="chopping chocolate, but chips work too" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I suppose it should be noted that nut milks are probably an acquired taste — if you’re not crazy about almond milk, this may not convert you. But my husband and I loved it. It’s barely sweet (though you can add a little sugar if desired) and tastes spectacularly of chocolate and hazelnuts, without the dairy products muddling the flavor — it will not survive the weekend. It may not even survive this paragraph.</p><p><a title="chocolate toasted hazelnut milk" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3840/14960680088_c950143651_z.jpg alt="chocolate toasted hazelnut milk" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="chocolate and toasted hazelnut milk" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3886/14960535329_d136cab459_z.jpg alt="chocolate and toasted hazelnut milk" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Bake Pasta with Broccoli Rabe and Sausage</a> (this is so on our back-to-school menu)<br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Homemade Wheat Thins</a> (and this)<br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Roasted Tomato Soup with Broiled Cheddar</a> (and this)<br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Grape Focaccia with Rosemary</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Melon Agua Fresca</a>, <a href=#>Cubed, Hacked Caprese</a>, <a href=#>Tomato and Corn Pie</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Marinated Eggplant with Capers and Mint</a>, <a href=#>Sour Cherry Compote</a> and <a href=#>Cold-Brewed Iced Coffee</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spicy Soba Noodles with Shiitakes</a></p><p><b>Chocolate and Toasted Hazelnut Milk</b></p><p>This is one of those recipes that I thought I came up with on my own (I mean, I did) but it turns out, I’m not the first one to have this inspiration because, obviously, chocolate hazelnut milk is a beautiful thing. You can see many other iterations <a href=#>here</a>. Most I’ve seen either use raw hazelnuts, more water, sugar substitutes, cocoa or cocoa nibs. I opted instead for well-toasted hazelnuts for maximum flavor. I found that holding back the water slightly made it creamier, and with a good semi-sweet chocolate, it had a nice, mild sweetness (although children may not agree). You could add a teaspoon of sugar, simple syrup or your sweetener of choice to the mixture, or more to taste, if it’s not sweet enough for you.</p><p>I imagine this would be wonderful in an iced coffee drink or milkshake, but we just like it straight from the fridge in a glass.</p><p>Yield: About 3 3/4 cups chocolate hazelnut milk (or 3 2/3 cups toasted hazelnut milk, without the chocolate). We had 3/4 cup servings, so it serves 5.</p><p>2 cups (10 ounces or 285 grams) hazelnuts<br>3 1/2 cups (830 grams) water, plus more for soaking<br>1 1/4 cups (7 1/2 ounces 215 grams) semisweet chocolate chips or rough-chopped chocolate<br>Sugar or a sweetener to taste (optional)</p><p>Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread hazelnuts on a tray and bake for 10 minutes, then toss them around and return them to the oven for another 2 to 5 minutes, until they’re fragrant and golden brown under their skins. Let cool to lukewarm. Place in a large bowl or jar and cover with an inch or so of water. Let soak overnight or up to two days at room temperature.</p><p>Drain hazelnuts and rinse, then place in a food processor or blender. (If you have both, I’d opt for the blender.) Add 3 1/2 cups water and blend for longer than seems necessary to puree them. Set a mesh strainer over a large bowl. Line it with a fine-mesh cheesecloth such as butter muslin or nut milk bag or a lint-free dish towel, leaving overhang so that you’ll have enough cloth to wring the mixture out in a few minutes.</p><p>Pour blended hazelnut mixture through cloth; you can use a spoon to stir it and help it along. When you’ve got mostly semi-solids left in the cloth, pull up the sides and use it to wring what you can from the hazelnuts.* What’s in your bowl is now the toasted hazelnut milk.</p><p>In a large saucepan or microwave-safe bowl, melt your chocolate halfway, then stir it off the heat until it it finishes melting. Whisk in 1 cup toasted hazelnut milk, at first one teaspoon at at time and then in a thin stream until you have a smooth chocolate-hazelnut sauce. Whisk this into the remaining toasted hazelnut milk. Chill until needed.</p><p><u>Do ahead:</u> I’ve read that nut milks only keep for two days, but could this be true? I would have guessed a week. I will update this with a firmer estimate once I learn/experiment more.</p><p>* What to do with the leftover nut meal? I’ve seen suggestions to toast it in a pan to dry it out and then add the nut meal to baked goods and/or granola. Let me know if you have a creative use for it.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-12636 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-12636 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
