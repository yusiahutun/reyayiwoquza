As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways,” the statement read. “Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend. Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence. We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone. We ask for privacy at this time as we are still processing this devastating loss.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a statement published by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2023/08/angus-cloud-death-sam-levinson-euphoria-tributes-1235451933/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a>, Euphoria creator Sam Levinson said, “There was no one quite like Angus.

I always will. Rest in peace and God Bless his family.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other Euphoria cast members also took to social media to mourn the shocking loss.
