The pair didn't even confirm their split when news surfaced that they had broken up in early 2023. While it was initially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>reported</strong></a> that the split was "not dramatic," it seems as though there may have been some drama behind the scenes.</p><p>Not only did Taylor stop performing her love song "Invisible String" in concert in favor of the more melancholy "The 1," almost all of her closest friends unfollowed Joe on social media. Some fans even believe Taylor’s Midnights vault track, "You're Losing Me," is about her split from Joe. Although Taylor hasn’t spoken out herself, fans believe her actions have shown that she’s not on good terms with Joe.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ca9cfd65-adbc-40ef-8616-f37395dcd9c8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b50bbc-1e4d-4ef3-9a20-3ae0db6bb4be data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/21/5by4/2023/07/07/21ad12f4e33d419ca66622fb31b80555_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Taylor Swift's Version of Speak Now Includes Controversial Lyrics Change -- How Fans Are Reacting</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a></p><p>Taylor had a whirlwind relationship with Tom Hiddleston, dating him for three months in 2016. Their relationship ended just as suddenly as it began and while they never shared what went wrong, Tom has had nothing but kind things to say about Taylor.</p><p>"Taylor is an amazing woman. She's generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GQ</strong></a> in 2017, adding, "Of course it was real."</p><p>While the pair seem to be on good terms, Tom admitted that the split was difficult for him, especially with all the media attention surrounding their relationship. Looking back, he says the former couple just wanted a regular relationship.</p><p>"A relationship exists between two people. We will always know what it was. The narratives that are out there altogether have been extrapolated from pictures that were taken without consent or permission, with no context," he said. "A relationship in the limelight…A relationship always takes work. A relationship in the limelight takes work. And it's not just the limelight.

While their relationship was mostly kept on the down low, their breakup was highly publicized and very dramatic. While Calvin originally tweeted that there was still a "huge amount of love and respect" between them, things changed when it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>revealed</strong></a> that Taylor had secretly written Calvin's song "This Is What You Came For" under a pseudonym.</p><p>It was reported that while the couple were still dating, Calvin gave an interview about the song where he said he couldn't foresee ever working with Taylor -- despite the fact that she had a large role in writing the song. The report painted Calvin in a negative light, causing him to go off on Twitter, even referencing Taylor’s new relationship with Tom Hiddleston.</p><p>"Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage…I figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do. I know you're off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it," Harris wrote in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>now-deleted tweets</strong></a>. "Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you’ve earned a great one."</p><p>While Calvin seemed angry at the time, he later admitted that he regretted his Twitter rant about Taylor.</p><p>"When it ended, all hell broke loose. Now I see that Twitter thing as a result of me succumbing to pressure. It took me a minute to realize that none of that matters. I'm a positive guy. For both of us, it was the wrong situation. It clearly wasn't right, so it ended, but all of the stuff that happened afterwards," Calvin told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>British GQ</strong></a> in September 2016.</p><p>In 2017, the magazine <a href=#><strong>shared</strong></a> some of Calvin's additional comments from the interview where he said the Twitter situation was "completely the wrong instinct" and an attempt at "protecting" what he sees as his "one talent in the world being belittled."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:276b1957-4a08-4bfa-b608-bce1b617b4cd data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b50bbc-1e4d-4ef3-9a20-3ae0db6bb4be data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c6/5by4/2023/06/09/c6fc87b7ccdb44549c465bbaf1bf9b72_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Taylor Swift's Eras Tour: All The Celebs Who Have Attended So Far</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a></p><p>Taylor dated Harry Styles for just a few months -- from October 2012 to January 2013. In the wake of their split, there was a lot of speculation and quite a few songs written about each other. Despite parting ways, Taylor and Harry have appeared to remain cordial through the years. In 2017, Harry even looked back on their relationship, speaking out about the iconic photos of the pair walking through Central Park.</p><p>"When I see photos from that day, I think: Relationships are hard, at any age. And adding in that you don't really understand exactly how it works when you're 18, trying to navigate all that stuff didn't make it easier. I mean, you're a little bit awkward to begin with. You're on a date with someone you really like. It should be that simple, right? It was a learning experience for sure. But at the heart of it -- I just wanted it to be a normal date," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rolling Stone</strong></a>.</p><p>He later added, "Certain things don't work out. There's a lot of things that can be right, and it's still wrong. In writing songs about stuff like that, I like tipping a hat to the time together. You're celebrating the fact it was powerful and made you feel something, rather than 'this didn't work out, and that's bad.' And if you run into that person, maybe it's awkward, maybe you have to get drunk…but you shared something. Meeting someone new, sharing those experiences, it's the best s--t ever. So thank you."</p><p>The pair even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>briefly reunited</strong></a> at both the 2021 and 2023 Grammys, where they could be seen having friendly chats.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bf78ba06-fc4d-4aa4-b7e0-cb93ba6d3369 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b50bbc-1e4d-4ef3-9a20-3ae0db6bb4be data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/10/5by4/2022/04/28/1059758a8dc3439a83950d61985e0eed_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Pete Davidson's Complete Dating History: From His First Love to Madelyn Cline</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>Conor Kennedy</strong></a></p><p>In 2012, Taylor briefly dated Robert F. Kennedy's grandson, Conor Kennedy. The couple spent the summer at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts -- and Taylor purchased a home nearby soon after. After some controversy surrounding their age difference and their attendance at a wedding they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>reportedly</strong></a> weren't invited to, the couple called it quits.</p><p>Taylor and Conor have never spoken out about their summer romance, although some of the songs on Red were rumored to be about their relationship. While talking about her dating life shortly after their split, Taylor admitted she struggled to date in the public eye.</p><p>"I don’t know how to have a normal relationship because I try to act normal, love from a normal place and live a normal life, but there is sort of an abnormal magnifying glass, like telescope lens, on everything that happens between me and anybody else," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>said</strong></a>. "I don’t really know that much about love, it turns out."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7ac05715-adaf-5085-bba3-ff075e1a5988 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b50bbc-1e4d-4ef3-9a20-3ae0db6bb4be data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/82/5by4/2016/05/26/82e4e100f0d25d92a97ac6e92f72d466_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Jake Gyllenhall Freaks the Eff Out at Amy Schumer In Hilarious "Catfish" Spoof</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></a></p><p>In late 2010, Taylor began dating Jake Gyllenhaal. The couple dated for a few months, splitting in early 2011. Following their breakup, Jake became the subject of rumors that some songs on Taylor’s Red were about him. The pair were both tight-lipped for years but their relationship made headlines once again when Taylor released a 10-minute version of her song "All Too Well."</p><p>"It was a day when I was just, like, a broken human, walking into rehearsal just feeling terrible about what was going on in my personal life," she explained on Rolling Stone's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>500 Greatest Albums</strong><strong> podcast</strong></a>.</p><p>Along with the full song, which was long speculated to be about Jake, Taylor also released a short film starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien -- whose ages line up with how old Taylor and Jake were during their relationship. The video depicted a toxic relationship, which many fans speculated reflected how Jake treated Taylor.</p><p>In the wake of the song's release, Jake was once again asked about the pair's relationship. He took the opportunity to call out Taylor's fans for bullying him online.</p><p>"At some point, I think it's important when supporters get unruly that we feel a responsibility to have them be civil and not allow for cyberbullying in one's name," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Esquire</strong></a>. "That begs for a deeper philosophical question. Not about any individual, per se, but a conversation that allows us to examine how we can -- or should, even -- take responsibility for what we put into the world, our contributions into the world. How do we provoke a conversation? We see that in politics. There’s anger and divisiveness, and it’s literally life-threatening in the extreme."</p><p>As for the song, he said, "It is her expression. Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don't begrudge anyone that."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:faf2046a-b78d-4405-9cab-a9ae6bb13ad8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b50bbc-1e4d-4ef3-9a20-3ae0db6bb4be data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5f/5by4/2023/05/18/5f4c41aae5264f79a4faaba670aa435c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Taylor Lautner Explains 'Praying' For John Mayer Comment Ahead of Taylor Swift's Album Re-Release</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a></p><p>Taylor was linked with John Mayer from late 2009 to early 2010.</p><p>While she is not one to name drop in her songs, she was very pointed in her release of "Dear John." On the track, Taylor commented, "Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home."</p><p>Looking back a few years later, John said he had no warning the song was going to be released and it made him "feel terrible."</p><p>"I didn't deserve it. I'm pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rolling Stone</strong></a>. "I never got an email. I never got a phone call. I was really caught off-guard, and it really humiliated me at a time when I'd already been dressed down. I mean, how would you feel if, at the lowest you've ever been, someone kicked you even lower?"</p><p>Through the years, the former couple's relationship has seemed to improve, with John even calling Taylor’s album <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>"a fine piece of work."</strong></a> Then, ahead of the rerelease of "Speak Now," Taylor asked fans to be kind to those she’s written songs about, seemingly referencing John.</p><p>"I'm 33 years old. I don't care about anything that happened to me when I was 19," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>said</strong></a>. "I was hoping to ask you, that as we lead up to this album, I would love for that kindness and that gentleness to extend onto our Internet activities. Right? I'm not putting this album out so you can go on the Internet and defend me against someone you think I wrote a song about 14 million years ago.

He even inspired Taylor's song "Back to December," where she looks back fondly on their relationship and offers an apology for ending things.
