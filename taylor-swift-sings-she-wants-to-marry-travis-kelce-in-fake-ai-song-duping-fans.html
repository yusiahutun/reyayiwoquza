Swifties were fuming. They managed to report the vile fake photos and have users suspended who shared them. It took a few days for X (<a href=#>Twitter</a>) to be able to turn on the search function again. But a valuable lesson wasn’t learned. As now, just weeks later, a new fake song, claimed to be leaked from <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, singing she wants to ‘marry’ Travis Kelce, and it’s clearly AI working overtime.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-new-song-is-just-ai-trying-to-get-in-on-the-hype-over-travis-kelce>Taylor Swift’s ‘new song’ is just AI trying to get in on the hype over Travis Kelce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1564226733-1-1024x683.jpg><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> is storming the world right now. No one is as big as Taylor Swift. After being dubbed the ‘<a href=#>best thing to happen to the NFL</a>‘, reports show the football league had their most successful season ever. More people watched the Super Bowl – and that <a href=#>kiss between Taylor and Travis Kelce</a> on the field – since the 1960s.</p><p>Her Eras Tour is currently taking over Australia, with <a href=#>Travis flying 9000 miles</a> to spend a few days with his girlfriend last week.</p><p>The star also made history at the <a href=#>Grammys</a>, after winning Album of the Year again. The <a href=#>music</a> gods are listening, but so is everyone else – like people who use AI.</p><p>Now, a new song has been ‘leaked’ claiming to be from Taylor Swift’s upcoming album, and it revolves around <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>. It’s pretending it’s called ‘The Ring’ and in the lyrics, she says she wants her own – <a href=#>an engagement ring</a> – after Travis one his at the Super Bowl.</p><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> users are playing the ‘song’ to their friends, recording their reactions after telling them it’s real.</p><p>Although Taylor Swift’s new album is set to arrive in less than two months, it’s not real.</p><p>Not only that, but the lyrics aren’t exactly as poetic as any of her previous albums.</p><p>But it’s still duping hardcore fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-not-the-first-time>It’s not the first time</h2><p>The songwriter has been targeted before, back in November. UK musician Ben Hill, who performs under the stage name Posse Unit, released a track called Get Your Head On This. It reached the 28th spot on the UK iTunes chart and used Taylor Swift’s voice using AI software Lala.ai – but didn’t mention Travis Kelce, thank goodness.</p><p>But it’s still scary.</p><p>Hill at the time claimed he tried to get in contact with her team to use her AI voice, and tried DM’ing her on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. When she didn’t reply? He went ahead anyway.</p><p>He hoped she’d hear the song and fall in love with it, and ask him to duet on stage with him when she comes to the UK with her <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eDcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aqoqaXqHq0tMRmrpqmpKh6tbuMppirqqliwbOt1aKqZqOVobCmecinZJ%2BZm5p6orWMrKann12ZwrG1zaBkn5meqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
