Todd, the name of his best friend is tattooed on the insides of his lips. Other than that he also has an elephant and an Arabic phrase that translates to ‘never not forget’ in English. He also had a finger tattoo but got that lasered off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/francesca-andamp-harry-reveal-matching-tattoos-on-i.jpeg><p><strong>What’s up with him lately?</strong></p><p>Recently Jowsey got into a controversy with popular influencer and makeup guru, James Charles. He was heard calling Charles a homophobic slur in a segment that was not supposed to be part of his podcast, which sparked outrage from the LGBTQ community, especially considering Jowsey had previously shown support for Trans rights. “James Charles is trying to f*** me…the makeup artist. You don’t know who he is? Just some f*****,” said Jowsey.</p><p>The original podcast was 40 minutes long, however it was cut down to 27 minutes. He quickly apologized to the LGBTQ community, and on an Instagram live stream, he addressed the matter. “The person that I said these things about, I did immediately apologize. I’ve mended things in private. I just wanted to come on here and say that I am extremely embarrassed about myself, my actions, and the fact that I let such a word slip out,” Jowsey said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/harry-jowsey-apologises-for-calling-james-charles.jpeg><p>Source: Google images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmislaG5urPUqaqhraBjsLC5jqGYq6qpYreww9KesGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
