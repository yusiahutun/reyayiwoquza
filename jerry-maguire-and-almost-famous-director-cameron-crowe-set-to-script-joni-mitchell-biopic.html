Instead, Crowe and Mitchell have collaborated on the project for the past two years.</p><p>The Oscar-winning filmmaker has yet to release any new projects since the 2016 Showtime series; Roadies was canceled after one season – although he did produce the 2019 documentary David Crosby: Remember My Name, about the folk-rock singer/songwriter who passed away in January 2023</p><p>Sources cite to Above the Line that Crowe has been writing about Mitchell since he worked as a teenage reporter for Rolling Stone – hence the story to the very personal movie, Almost Famous, and that Mitchell has grown to trust him, so the script is being written with plenty of her input.</p><p>In 2017, Crowe escorted Mitchell to Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy party, only two years after suffering her brain aneurysm. In addition, Crowe interviewed her for the Los Angeles Times before&nbsp;the 50th anniversary of her album Blue.</p><p>Whether Crowe will cast one or several actresses to play Mitchell throughout various eras of her life has yet to be reported, but if history tells the tale, all signs point to big names within the Hollywood circle. In the past, he’s worked with Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky), Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson (We Bought a Zoo), and Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand (Almost Famous), among others. Crowe also directed Cuba Gooding, Jr. to an Oscar win for his performance alongside Cruise in Jerry Maguire.</p><p>Mitchell is considered one of the world’s most influential and respected folk singers and among the greatest songwriters ever. The 10-time Grammy winner was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, designs her album covers, and her 1971 album, Blue, is often heralded as one of the “best of all time.”</p><p>Most recently, Mitchell performed at The Library of Congress in Washington, DC, as part of Gershwin Prize week and is scheduled for a live performance in June at the Gorge Amphitheatre in Washington state. The show, called Joni Jam, has yet to release the entire lineup.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJJoaXBnmpq%2Fs8WMppigrZmnsm6tzZ1kmqSdpMC1ecWapKito2Kxqr7EnKuoql2Yrq6x0ailZpuipMSmedKeq2asn2LApL7Iqatmop%2Bjtm65yK2aoZ2coXqjtc6poJxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
