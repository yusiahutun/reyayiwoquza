Max, nothing. Please, Max, stop! That’s not funny. Seriously, don’t film it, Erase the footage now, okay?”</p><p>In the caption, the <a href=#>movie</a> star joked: “Come on…we all have one [shh emoji], #secretcloset&nbsp;#monica.”</p><p>Of course, she’s relating back to the iconic Season 8 Friends scene in the episode: “The One With The Secret Closet” where Matthew Perry, aka Chandler, finds out his wife has been hiding her ‘secret’ messy closet from him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-post-sends-friends-fans-into-a-frenzy>The post sends Friends fans into a frenzy</h2><p>Since it seems unlikely that Friends fans will ever get a reunion episode, they’ll have to carry on watching on <a href=#>Netflix</a> for now. However, since Courteney gave them some content to enjoy, of course, they went wild with references from the hit show in the comments.</p><p>“Maybe it’s Richard in there,” joked one fan.</p><p>Another penned: “’Hehe you’re messy’ (cue Chandler Bing laugh face).”</p><p>“She’s so (MONICA GELLER),” laughed another.</p><p>Others couldn’t help but drop an array of Chandler gifs in the comments, and we’re absolutely here for it!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2d%2BcK%2FOrqmtnZ6axm6vzrFkqaqfq7K0ec2oZKimlWKyrb%2FEZpqorZyZeqmt1Z5kqaSRrrKlecyopaKbkWK2r3nFq6CeppSoenN8jLKcmqqjYrmiwMSrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
