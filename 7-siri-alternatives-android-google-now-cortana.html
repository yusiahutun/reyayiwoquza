Now we need our phones daily to wake us up in the morning with an alarm, set reminders on our calendars, look up random questions, and so much more. And having a virtual assistant like Siri makes those tasks so much easier to carry out. But is there a Siri for Android?</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Siri may have been the first digital assistant to become mainstream, but she's certainly not the only one now. Even iPhone users have sometimes turned away from Siri in favor of a different virtual assistant app, some of which are surely on this list.</p><p>So while there is no Android version of Siri, here are seven great alternatives that are just as good---if not better.</p><h2 id=google-assistant>1.

You can access it by holding the home button or, on some devices, squeezing your phone by its sides. And instead of "Hey Siri" you can launch it by saying "Hey Google" instead.</p><p>As you might expect, Assistant can make calendar appointments and answer questions. But with it, Google is trying to expand our idea of what digital personal assistants can do, like place calls and make reservations on your behalf.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Assistant</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=hound>2.

Hound can help you do all the usual assistant tasks like setting alarms and timers, telling you the news or the weather, and calling and texting contacts.</p><p>But Hound can also help you with really advanced requests, like searching for barbecue restaurants rated only 4 stars or more near you. Hound also helps you search for songs you need to know the name of, look up random questions, and can even book an Uber for you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hound</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=amazon-alexa>3.

Alexa has become a household assistant, so why not use her on your phone as well? If you have an Amazon Echo speaker or other household gadgets that support Alexa, then downloading Alexa as your personal assistant is a no-brainer.</p><p>Alexa will incorporate into your life super easily if you've already been using her elsewhere in your home. Once you open the Alexa app, you log into your Amazon account to connect everything together and you're good to go.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Alexa can help you set timers and alarms, tell you the weather, answer your questions, and so much more. You can even <a href=#>use Alexa as a personal trainer</a>.</p><p>As mentioned before, Alexa will work with other household gadgets that support her too. So if you have an air fryer or coffee maker that works with Alexa, she can help you set timers specifically for those devices.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Alexa</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=robin>4.

So if that's when you find yourself needing a virtual assistant the most to help you out, download Robin.</p><p>She can play different playlists, send texts for you, set reminders and alarms, help you get directions, and more.
