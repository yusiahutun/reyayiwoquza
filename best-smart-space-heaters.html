Choose a space heater with tip-over and overheat protection so that it will automatically shut off if there's an issue, or notify you via your smartphone.</p><h3>How much energy does a space heater use on average?</h3><p>On average, most space heaters use around 1500W per hour. They are useful in situations where you need to heat a room quickly, but not particularly energy-efficient when using them as a long-term solution.</p><h3>Can I leave a space heater on overnight?</h3><p>Space heaters that feature a timer, eco mode (where the heater automatically switches off when the desired temperature is reached), and anti-tip/overheat protection can be left on overnight. While it's preferable not to leave heaters on when you're not in the same room, most smart space heaters shouldn't be a problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>Can I plug a smart space heater into a smart plug?</h3><p>Most smart plugs should be able to handle the load of a smart space heater. While this might not be outwardly encouraged, it's <a href=#>not dangerous to plug a smart space heater into a smart plug</a>.</p><h3>How do I reset a smart space heater?</h3><p>Some space heaters will feature a reset button; others may need to be unplugged for over 30 seconds, then reconnected.
