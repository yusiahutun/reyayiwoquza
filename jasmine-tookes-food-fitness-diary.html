Just another reason to fall in love with 25-year-old Victoria’s Secret Angel&nbsp;<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_jasmine-tookes data-tag=jasmine-tookes>Jasmine Tookes</a></strong>. She, like you, will dive into a sausage-and-egg sandwich for breakfast, hates juices cleanses, and gets her workout motivation from Instagram. <a href=# id=auto-tag_supermodels data-tag=supermodels>Supermodels</a>—they’re just like us.</p><p>The L.A. native—whose beautiful looks are thanks to European, African, Brazilian, and West Indian ancestors—earned her Angel wings last year&nbsp;and&nbsp;got her start on the commercial side, landing campaigns for&nbsp;Gap and DKNY in 2010. Then she booked a&nbsp;DKNY campaign in 2011, along with a spread for Italian Vogue, which set her on a trajectory to model Spring 2012 collections around the world for luxury brands such as Calvin Klein, Jason Wu, Tom Ford, Prada, Miu Miu, and Versace.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8327116i.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/coca-rocha.jpg><p>We caught up with the supermodel at a recent Victoria’s Secret event to chat with her about the food and fitness routine she swears by.</p><p><strong>For breakfast I had:</strong><br>A sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich.</p><p><strong>For lunch I had:</strong><br>Grilled chicken with vegetables—broccoli and zucchini—and rice. I like&nbsp;to eat a lot of protein.</p><p><strong>For dinner I had:</strong><br>Steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I’m a later-dinner person so I have it&nbsp;at like 10 p.m.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jasmine-tookes-food-and-fitness-diary.jpg><p><strong>Today I snacked on:</strong><br>Apples and peanut butter. I love peanut butter!</p><p><strong>My favorite workout is:</strong><br>I do barre classes at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Physique 57</a>, I think it’s really good and gives you a nice little bum, so I do it twice a week. I also do a lot of weight training filled with squats and lunges and all that fun stuff.</p><p><strong>My favorite healthy restaurant is:</strong><br>I love <a href=# rel=nofollow>Westville</a>. I get the grilled chicken and&nbsp;the string beans with soy sauce.</p><p><strong>The health trend I just can’t get behind is:<br></strong>I think it’s the juices, I can’t get into the juices. They’re not for me.</p><p><strong>The one thing I would never eat is:</strong><br>Maybe oysters, or clams. I don’t like that, I’m not into it.</p><p><strong>On Instagram I’m obsessed with following:<br></strong>You know what, I do follow this one Instagram called <a href=# rel=nofollow>Motivation for Fitness</a>. Whenever I’m scrolling on the page I’m like, “OK, it’s time for the gym.” It just motivates me.</p><p><strong>The three ingredients you’ll always find in my kitchen are:<br></strong>Salt, soy sauce, and water. Clearly I’m a salty person.</p><p><strong>I start an average day by:</strong><br>Waking up, washing my face, taking my dogs out for a walk. I’ll probably go to the gym after that and if I’m working I’ll go to work; otherwise, I’ll stay home and just relax. I’ll often sit at home for a little bit, relax on the couch, and catch up on TV shows or go down to SoHo and go shopping or for lunch.</p><p><strong>My biggest health tip for travelers is to:</strong><br>I like to always have protein bars with me in case I need something to snack on. I don’t like the airport food so I always have those with me to get my protein.</p><p><strong>My signature healthy dish&nbsp;is:</strong><br>Sometimes I cook, when I’m training hard and getting ready for the [Victoria’s Secret] show and stuff. I’ll do just like grilled chicken with zucchini. Simple and grilled all together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jasmine-tookes-food-fitness-diary.jpg><p><strong>On my workout playlist right now you’ll find:</strong><br>I’m really into <strong>Rihanna</strong>’s new album, <a href=#>particularly the “Work” song.</a> Work, work, work…. That one. [Laughs.] Now it’s going to be stuck in my head all day. I always like Major Lazer, they have good workout, motivation songs.</p><p><strong>The best party of my job is:</strong><br>Traveling and also getting to do fun events with the Victoria’s Secret family. Plus, we get access to all the beautiful <a href=# rel=nofollow>lingerie</a>, which is perfect for gifts, especially Valentine’s Day.</p><p><strong>My favorite activewear brand is:</strong><br><a href=# rel=nofollow>Victoria’s Secret Sport</a>—they have my favorite pair of pants that fit very well and are very comfortable. I wear a long legging.</p><p><strong>My&nbsp;winter health and fitness tip&nbsp;is:</strong><br>Stay hydrated and don’t be like, “I’m not going outside it’s too cold.” Get into it, you have to get out and get stuff done.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhtYmZ%2BeIWOo5ispZmjsm7Azqiinqtdm7ywsIyfoK2mlajAbrDImqmyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
