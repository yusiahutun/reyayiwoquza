But even if you don’t have the HSR today, you will have it one day, whether you like it or not,” Goh said, adding the economic spillovers of new urban areas and tighter connections to Singapore were also obvious.</p>Prime Minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Anwar Ibrahim</span></a>’s administration in July launched a request for information (RFI) process for the HSR project, which analysts follow to gauge interest among potential contractors to build the rail line<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The RFI process was extended to January 15, but at least five major local firms began moves as early as May this year to set up conglomerates to take on the project if and when it opens for competitive bidding.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Analysts say leading companies in the running for a tender include YTL Corp, which was among the firms that won contracts under the original HSR project. Logistics giant MMC Corp and WCT Holdings, the Berjaya Group and Malaysian Resources Corp are all also expected to bid for a role, given extensive experience in construction and property development.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/10/02/EXPLAIN_Thu_Clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">05:43</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Indonesia’s flagship Bandung-Jakarta high-speed railway finally launches after series of delays</p><p>Indonesia’s flagship Bandung-Jakarta high-speed railway finally launches after series of delays</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Resurrecting the project, however, may end up incurring a cost that Malaysia’s government cannot afford.</p>Cost was the main reason the initial project was suspended in 2018 by then-prime minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Mahathir Mohamad</span></a>, who returned to power then for a second stint to clean up what he described as overly-expensive projects that fed corruption in his former protégé <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Najib Razak</span></a>’s regime.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier this month, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said any progress on infrastructure projects would depend on how much the government could afford to spend, adding that the HSR needed to be funded by the private sector for it to be a viable option.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Funding will be the biggest challenge,” said Rosli Khan, a managing director at logistics and transport consultancy MDS Consultant Group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the project is financially viable, the private sector could easily pay and fund it.

A post put up by the administrator of his Facebook page hit out at his successors for dismantling his initial HSR project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“During Najib’s time, we could afford it.
