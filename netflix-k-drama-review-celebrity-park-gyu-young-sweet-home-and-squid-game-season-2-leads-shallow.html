We know those are freebies from brands who also pay the influencers handsomely to highlight products on their accounts. Yet people buy them anyway.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">6 of the best new Korean drama series to look out for in July 2023</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Online celebrities rise like phoenixes, admired for their fashion and charm. Yet nothing gets the online community more excited than the fall of a phoenix who bursts into flames and crashes to Earth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Celebrity’s phoenix is Seo Ah-ri (Park), who lives in a humble home with her mother and works as a door-to-door make-up saleswoman – a job on which the skills she honed will later be put to use elsewhere.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ah-ri doesn’t use social media at first, but that changes after a meeting with her childhood friend Oh Min-hye (Jun Hyo-seong), an influencer with over 300,000 followers. Ah-ri doesn’t recognise Min-hye straight away, but her fawning friend Yoon Jeong-sun (Park Ye-ni) does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/13/4102bed5-a0ce-49a7-98bb-9379843dd1e4_ea94c24a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Friends might not be the best way to describe them. Ah-ri used to be rich and Min-hye was a hanger-on who was jealous of her wealth. Seeing Ah-ri again, Min-hye is desperate to flaunt her status to her, not realising that Ah-ri has fallen on hard times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Min-hye invites Ah-ri to a celebrity party where she introduces her to the catty Gabin Society influencer group. Ah-ri’s mother, who runs a dry-cleaning business, insists Ah-ri borrows a fetching tweed dress suit to wear at the party.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Only two sets of the outfit were ever made, and the owner of one of them happens to be Yoon Shi-hyeon (Lee Chung-ah), the eonni (big sister) of the Gabin Society and the only one not on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/13/e2954907-a740-4a8b-87a7-e89642e87db7_ea94c24a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ah-ri is outed as a “former” member of the elite at the party and a glass of wine is thrown over her expensive suit, which is the one that belongs to Shi-hyeon. However, she stands up for her herself and a new social media star is born.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Min-hye and her Gabin cohorts, save for the refined Shi-hyeon, resent Ah-ri’s new-found fame. Tensions rise with Ah-ri’s success, which soon eclipses that of everyone else in the group. She eventually surpasses the vaunted one-million-followers mark, thanks to her fashion sense and business acumen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All of this is shown in flashbacks, with episodes beginning and ending with snippets of a live broadcast of Ah-ri’s confession. This stream shocks the nation, as Ah-ri was believed to have died three months earlier.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">10 best K-dramas of 2023 so far ranked: Bloodhounds, The Glory and more</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She tells the story of her rise, and several falls, revealing the lies and crimes of the Gabin Society and their enablers along the way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Celebrity makes a point of highlighting the negative side of online celebrity, it does so in a distressingly classist way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The only morally upright characters in the show are Ah-ri, Shi-hyeon and the handsome and aloof cosmetics company heir Han Jun-kyung (Kang Min-hyuk of the K-pop group CNBlue).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/13/03850a70-7518-42a1-8912-c983672c888a_ea94c24a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All of them are from old money and seemingly immune to the vanity of social media. Ah-ri may be a social media star, but it’s a tool she uses to build a successful fashion empire.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All the other influencers or online commenters, including Ah-ri’s friend Jeong-sun and a meddling character who goes by the handle _bbbfamous, are shown to be hopelessly shallow and insecure. None of them come from money and all of them are corrupted by vanity and jealousy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Averaging only 45 minutes, Celebrity’s episodes run on the short side for a K-drama. Then again, there isn’t much to the story. It’s nice to see a show with fewer secondary plot strands, but their absence here only highlights the weaknesses of the main one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/13/9dcacdff-37ce-4ae1-aafb-fd6f50a53b21_ea94c24a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ah-ri’s ups and downs become increasingly repetitive, and the live-stream framing device that bookends each episode offers no new information until the flashbacks finally catch up with it at the end of the series. Yet after all that build-up, the finale proves anticlimactic.</p>Celebrity is shallow in its rendering of a compelling social paradox, and is hobbled by its repetitive structure and a weak cast – save for Park, who recently signed on to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">season two of Squid Game</span></a>. Still, it retains some value as an unintentional experiment.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People have watched the show and acknowledged its message about the dark side of influencer culture, yet the internet has been flooded with posts and articles about where to find the outfits worn in the show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then again, there is no such thing as bad publicity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Celebrity is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWtubmljZLumwMWloLFlm2Kxs63MmmSrnaaesrh5wp6jnpqinsG6ec%2BaqaRll67CbsXOrqWgZaOssqbAjKGmpp1dlruledKqrKKcXZyurrGMrJyaq5%2BjenN5y56YnatdqLWiuMuorg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
