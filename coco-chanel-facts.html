The name Coco is thought to have come from her time as a cabaret singer. She became known for singing “Ko Ko Ri Ko” and “Qui qu’a vu Coco”. Later in life she told people that Coco was a childhood nickname. Perhaps because a cabaret career was ‘uncouth’ for a couture designer at the time.</p><p id=ek8qolBv63Kd data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Highlights from the F1 inspired Chanel cruise 2023 show</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/42734fae664c-coco-chanel-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eugeYYbKjPZA data-wc=7><strong>Coco Chanel was actually born Gabrielle Chanel</strong></p><h2><strong>Chanel was brought up in an Orphanage</strong></h2><p id=e9U23zAynCuT data-wc=41>Chanel along with her two sisters was sent to live in an orphanage by her father after their mother died of tuberculosis.

She opened her first boutique at 21 rue Cambon, Paris. It was named Chanel Modes and her hats were soon worn by well-known French actresses of the era, and helped build her reputation.</p><h2><strong>She had affairs but never married</strong></h2><p id=eMSLOrwrQD43 data-wc=115>It is documented that Chanel had 8 lovers, one of which was Hugh Richard Arthur Grosvenor, the 2nd Duke of Westminster who known to his close friends as "Bendor". She was introduced to him at the age of 40. After meeting the duke courted Chanel with extravagant gifts including a home in London's prestigious Mayfair area. Disguised as a deliveryman, Westminster once appeared at Chanel's apartment with an enormous bouquet of flowers. In 1927 he gave her a parcel of land on the French Riviera at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. It was there that Chanel built her villa, La Pausa. Their romantic liaison lasted ten years. She never married but was known for various high profile romantic conquests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a22c7b70cde9-chanel-duke-of-westminster-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ewCRpKmaUjk5 data-wc=13><strong>Chanel with her lover&nbsp;Duke of Westminster in 1924 at the Chester races</strong></p><h2><strong>Chanel was an Anglophile...</strong></h2><p id=ebnz3wPCZ0my data-wc=73>Few people know what Chanel was obsessed with the Scottish countryside. Apparently this was thanks to her liaison with the Duke of Westminster, who introduced her to British country pursuits. For a time she lived in a sprawling 20-bedroom estate called Rosehall House, which is located near Lairg in Scotland. The estate was owned by the Duke for just two years but in that time Chanel redecorated the pile to suit her tastes.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1rHyMaV9b-t data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Chanel AW22 wellies cemented the indie sleaze trend for 2022</a></strong></p><h2><strong>The real reason Chanel used tweed</strong></h2><p id=ejIuvDBXjujh><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a549945cad4-gabrielle-coco-chanel-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=eFO-FR4Aisz9 data-wc=60>Chanel is famous for its use of tweed, but did you know the fabric has little to do with the French origins of the brand?
