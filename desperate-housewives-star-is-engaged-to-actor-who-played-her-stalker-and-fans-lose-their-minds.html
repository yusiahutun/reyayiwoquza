Fans eagerly followed the lives of the group of women, seen through the eyes of their friend and neighbor who passed away during the pilot episodes. However, it looks like fans haven’t been watching the actual actors’ lives as eagerly, as they’ve only just found out that Andrea Bowen, who played Julie Mayer is actually engaged to her strangler on the show in real life.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-53278734-777x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-desperate-housewives-characters-julie-and-eddie-are-engaged-in-real-life>Desperate Housewives characters Julie and Eddie are engaged in real life</h2><p>Fans of the hit show will have the strangling storyline engraved in their heads, when it was revealed the killer that’s been&nbsp;stalking&nbsp;Wisteria Lane was, in fact, Eddie Orlofsky, played by Josh Zuckerman.</p><p>He also tried to kill Julie, thinking she was Susan. He attempted to strangle her to death, but when realized it was actually Mayer he was strangling, he ran away from the scene.</p><p>In the show, she survived the strangle, and in real life, she actually got engaged to the man who almost murdered her. Plot twist and a half.</p><p>Although their relationship “started in 2009, then again in 2018, then again in 2020,” some fans of the show are only just finding out now about it, as a <a href=#>TikTok</a> made by a fan goes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">viral</a>.</p><p>One fan even found the <a href=#>celebrity couple’s</a> wedding website, which they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> to Reddit, which read: “It all started in 2009, then again in 2018, then again in 2020.</p><p>“We won’t go too in-depth here with our ‘how we met’ story but it’s your basic boy meets girl, boy tries to kill girl, 9 years later boy and girl get pregnant with twins, girl ghosts boy (according to boy..girl doesn’t agree with this assessment) and a few years later they go on a first date. Classic..”</p><p>Fortunately, this was all a joke, and everything that was mentioned happened fictionally and not in real life. However, their love is in fact well and truly real.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-can-t-get-over-the-unlikely-pairing>Fans can’t get over the unlikely pairing</h2><p>The internet is slowly but surely starting to find out about the revelation, and everyone is just in shock, in a good way.</p><p>“Desperate Housewives is my fave and I never knew they were together!!!?? This has made my day!” exclaimed one.</p><p>“Omgggg I’m gonna cry,” penned another.</p><p>“Whaaaaaat my two fav characters,” a third excited fan wrote.</p><p>One joked: “I don’t think your mom will be happy to know you’re dating Eddie Orlofsky.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2Z9cLDErKeeqpGpsm60zq6qnq%2BZq7K0edKtmKtlmah6prrGmp6enF2pvG6twq2mq2WnnbxuvMuasJ6cXZ2ys3nSrZilo5WneqK6w2admqajYrmwv8Rmq6Gdmad6rrXNnapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
