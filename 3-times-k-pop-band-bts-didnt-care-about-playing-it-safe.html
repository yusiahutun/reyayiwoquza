And their fellow member Jin (real name Kim Seok-jin) was spotted wearing a white Marymond shirt during one of the group’s VLive broadcasts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some Japanese expressed outrage, but BTS’ formidable Japanese ARMY fan base remained supportive throughout.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What do celebrities say about Hong Kong's protests?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2. Their views on the LGBTIQ+ community</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">South Korea’s views on the LGBTIQ+ community tend to be conservative – gay TV personality and restaurateur Hong Seok-cheon caused a lot of controversy when he came out in 2000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While BTS hasn’t lent their official support to the community, RM and fellow band member Jungkook have covered openly gay singer Troye Sivan’s 2015 hit Fools. RM also received a lot of praise from international fans after he tweeted Sivan’s Strawberries and Cigarettes track from the 2018 coming-of-age film Love, Simon, about a gay teenager who falls in love, as one of his #RMusic recommendations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2013, RM also tweeted about his love of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’s Same Love – a 2012 hip-hop tune that has become an unofficial anthem for same sex marriage – stating that after understanding the lyrics, he loved the song even more.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a later interview with Billboard in 2018, the tweet was mentioned and RM said, “It’s hard to find the right words. To reverse the words: Saying ‘same love’ is saying ‘love is the same.’ I just really liked that song. That’s about all I have to say.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What did BTS get for performing at a friendship concert in Paris?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fellow rapper Suga (real name Min Yoon-gi) followed up by saying, “There’s nothing wrong. Everyone is equal.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No stranger to speculation, Suga caused a stir among fans when he shared his views on his “ideal type” in a 2013 interview with Oricon Buzz (which was later highlighted by popular international K-entertainment blog Seoulbeats).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">BTS was in the midst of promoting the Japanese album Danger, and the interviewer asked Suga what he notices first when he looks at girls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;He answered, “I focus on personality and atmosphere. I don’t have an ideal type and it’s not limited to a girl.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fans debated over potential mistranslation, as the words were translated from Korean to Japanese and then to English. The band has not commented on the subject since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Suga’s lyrics in Cypher Part. 3 have also been highly scrutinised by fans – in it Suga boasts that his voice turns people on, regardless of their gender, and that his “flexible tongue movements” would “send them to Hong Kong”. In Korean slang, to “send or take someone to Hong Kong” alludes to sexual pleasure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">3. Their lyrics</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While BTS’s lyrics are known for raising awareness about various social issues, they rarely take on political issues as directly as the track Am I Wrong from the 2016 album Wings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Suga raps, “We're all dogs and pigs/ we become dogs because we're angry.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The words, whose meaning may be lost on those outside South Korea, reference an incident many South Koreans felt strongly about.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Why are patriotic Koreans going on day trips to Dokdo islets?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prior to the release of Wings, a South Korean education ministry official, Na Hyang-wook, reportedly told journalists the country should put in place a class system that would classify 99 per cent of the population as dogs and pigs, and that they should be treated as such. Na later claimed he was drunk when making the statement, but the damage had already been done.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another jab at the then-administration was the use of the words “mayday, mayday” in the lyrics of the track, referencing the tragic 2014 Sewol ferry incident, where 300 people died.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
