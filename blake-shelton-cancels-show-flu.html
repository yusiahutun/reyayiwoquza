The show has been moved to Tuesday, Mar. 6.</p><p>As Shelton himself explained on social media, he almost never has to resort to postponing a show, but this particular strain of the flu just got the best of him. He apologized to fans who were hoping to enjoy the concert Saturday night.</p><p>Shelton also noted in a follow-up tweet that he promised fans he'd "make up for the inconvenience." He promised that his support guests <a href=#>Brett Eldredge</a>, <a href=#>Carly Pearce</a> and <a href=#>Trace Adkins</a> would still be on the bill at the make-up show. Ticket holders who aren't able to make Tuesday's date will get a full refund.</p><p>To Shelton's credit, he did not go down without a fight. The singer apparently was <a href=#>showing visible signs of the flu </a>when he performed at Rodeo Houston Thursday (Mar. 1), imploring the audience to help him out by singing along. He also put his nose to the grindstone and powered through his date in Dallas Mar. 2 while in full sickness mode. Hopefully a couple of days off will help him regain his health!</p><p>Shelton's <a href=#>Country Music Freaks Tour </a>is set to run through March. The singer and reality show star just released a new video for "I Lived It," which is the second single from Shelton's current album, Texoma Shore.</p><p><strong>This Is What Blake Shelton Was Thinking on Each of His Album Covers</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6SRoLJuv8eeo62nnmKworrCnqOsZaOdvLh5xaWsaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
