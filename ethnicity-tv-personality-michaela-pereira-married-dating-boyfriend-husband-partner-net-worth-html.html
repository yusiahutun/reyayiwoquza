I have connected with my blood -- my sibling. When I am asked how it feels, I say it's as though I found a part of me that I hadn't realized was missing. I cannot tell you how life-affirming and validating it has been to not only meet and fall in love with a new sister, but to learn about myself in the process. I no longer felt random, or like a mistake or an afterthought. My parents did everything they could to make me feel loved and connected and that I belonged. But some of those feelings I had were so deeply rooted to my very start in life that no amount of love and affection could help.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Similarly, her sister Marine equally contributed in making her understand how their mother was. She cooperated by all her means and helped her figure out what their mother was like. She said:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“That first night I talked about my mom for hours. I wanted Michaela to know that she was a good person. I tried to put myself in Michaela's shoes and understand how she might have felt about a woman who placed a child for adoption and never spoke of it again, even when she knew her time here on Earth was limited. I felt like I should defend her, she was my mother after all. I never had to do that, though. Michaela wasn't angry. Yes, she felt disappointment, but most of all she was grateful that our mother made the brave choice to place her for adoption.”</p><p>Since then, she has frequently been in touch with her sister and has consistently been meeting her.</p><p>Well, finding her birth sister is a real achievement for the lady than receiving any of the awards.&nbsp;Michaela Pereira did go through some hard time in her life, but&nbsp;her adopted parents left no stone unturned to make her a better-grown person. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Micheal adopted family inclusive of her adopted sisters and parents.</strong></p><p>Source: cnn.com <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, she has not disclosed any information about her adopted parent&nbsp;beside her mother's profession as a primary teacher and her father&nbsp;working for YMCA. The pair did not only adopt Micheal but also took four more children Darlene, really Laurie.</p><p>Mary Lou and Shiela. Well, we must say that humanity still exists as the adopted family of Micheal did provide them with all of the needs and eventually made them stand on their feet and making them independent and have a blissful life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZmadpJ27qq%2FIrbBmrKZivaa%2B0qilmqSZqcZuucicn5qdnJZ6sbHRnqCrmV2irrO%2ByJ6bZpyRqbavs4ybprKeop6yr7CMoaysmpGjsW68wKurp52iYrumwIywpqusmGO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
