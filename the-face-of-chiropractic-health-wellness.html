His precision with the Activator, Diversified and Thompson adjustment techniques, coupled with his concern for quality outcomes that last, make him the go-to chiropractor on the Treasure Coast. “I use traditional tried-and-true chiropractic procedures combined with today’s most-advanced technology to quickly find the source and solution for my patients’ problems,” he says. “Equally important is making sure we find long-term solutions to those problems. That way, they are less likely to be ongoing problems.” He knows from experience. A disc ailment as a child that later was found and corrected by a chiropractor is the reason he became one. “I suffered with leg pain ever since I was seven or eight years old,” he says. “It wasn’t until I was 20 that a friend referred me to a chiropractor.” Born and raised in West Palm Beach, he now lives in Sewall’s Point with his wife Jessica, five-year-old son Brander and two-year-old daughter Bleu Eloise. Together they enjoy boating, riding bikes and surfing, as well as taking family vacations to the Florida Keys, the Bahamas and Georgia.</p><p><strong>772.463.2344 • <a href=#>simpsonmedical.com</a></strong></p><p>Sponsored content</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZLOir8SsZKieXaKus8DIp2SsrF2hwqS1xGiroZ1dm66ksYyonWabmJ6%2FsLzRmpqtoZNitaaty62fZq%2BVobmvsdKsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
