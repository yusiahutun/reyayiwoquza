She started out strong with her tutorials, gained a huge following on both YouTube and Instagram, and she even released an acclaimed eyeshadow palette with no other than Morphe, the famous makeup brand for influencers to collaborate with.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, things started to go down once she released her second collaboration with Morphe, and it wasn’t as good as the original, and fans actually speculated that her eyeshadows in the second collection were the ones that didn’t make it to the first collection. This particular incident was back in 2018, but it didn’t end there.</span></p><p><span>In the summer of 2019, Jaclyn was under fire again due to her famous hairy lipsticks. Mentioned as the “lipstick gate”, the lipstick collection was Jaclyn’s first launch in her own brand, Jaclyn Cosmetics. However, influencers who received PR packages & customers who ordered off of Jaclyn’s website found fibers, bumps, sharp pieces, and more in their lipsticks. Some people received broken & melted lipsticks as well. Jaclyn’s first reaction was to blame anyone that bashed her lipsticks, but as she was getting more and more complaints, she basically ran off social media, until her second launch.</span></p><p><span>At this point her audience started to lose interest in Jaclyn’s videos as she seemed to only come to social media to promote or sell a product, and disappear afterwards. Her latest launch was just a few days ago, and it was not well received once again. Could we say disappointed but not surprised here?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Jaclyn released her “secret valentines day gift boxes” a few days ago on her Instagram Stories. In the stories, she mentioned different sized boxes with different products. This announcement was found to be a bit strange as Jaclyn’s reputation on creating products is not very good. Even her products that were showcased on her channel were received damaged and ruined by customers, and now she was trying to sell products without actually showing what they are. This was the first reaction to the launch.</span></p><p><span>During the actual launch, boxes were sold out even before their official launch time, and Jaclyn claimed they were so limited edition that there was no way she could bring back the boxes & products. Most fans were again disappointed, and people actually started to wonder why Jaclyn would launch such a limited collection, and have them sold out even before the actual time. However, shortly after people received their boxes, they also started speculating that these boxes were actually created for Christmas Holiday, and they might have been PR boxes that Jaclyn thought not to send to influencers, and sell as a fast cash grab. Even the product names in the boxes have a Christmas vibe such as All Lit Up, I’m So Lit, Twinkle, Flurries etc. The box also seemed Christmasy to fans as well, and if they are actually Christmas boxes, we are about to have another Lipstick Gate very soon.</span></p><p><strong>Stay tuned for more news on the Jaclyn Hill & more!
