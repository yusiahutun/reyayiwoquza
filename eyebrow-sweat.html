We’ll even suggest that if you’re just going to do one single thing to your face before you leave home, make it your brows.</p><p>But what’s the point of spending time grooming and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>filling in your brows</a> if they’re going to melt off midday? This problem is especially pressing during the summer or while working out when your face leans toward the sweaty side of things and your makeup can’t stay put. Your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>brows</a> are the last thing you want to see sacrificed to sweat, so we’ve put together this step-by-step guide on banishing eyebrow sweat issues once and for all.</p><p>Keep reading for how to get your arches to remain—well, arched—as told by someone who knows eyebrow sweat all too well. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Emma Lovewell</a>, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Peloton instructor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>author</a>, is here to spill the tea on her technique and must-try <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sweat-proof brow products</a>.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.40355805243446><h2>Face Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/too-faced-hangover-replenishing-face-primer-sephora.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=start-with-a-primer><strong>Start with a prime</strong>r</h2><p>“I always start with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>primer</a> to make sure my face is prepped and ready. Primer creates a smooth and hydrated base so the products adhere better,” Emma explains. And she’s absolutely right! You need to prep your canvas with a lasting product like <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Too Faced’s Hangover Replenishing Face Primer</a>. If it’s good enough for a Peloton instructor, it’s more than sufficient for your sweaty summer days or work sessions.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5353383458647><h2>Brow Pencil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sephora-collection-insta-brow-waxy-brow-pencil.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=use-long-lasting-brow-products><strong>Use long-lasting brow products</strong></h2><p>They’re definitely out there, and they’ll make your quest to avoid smudged, sweaty brows exponentially easier. If the product claims waterproof, water-resistant, or long-wearing properties, it’s likely a good bet for this purpose. Our expert’s top pick? <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sephora Collection’s Insta-Brow Waxy Brow Pencil</a>. It offers a sheer, buildable tint of color that still looks natural thanks to its blade-shaped tip. “I like that it’s long-lasting and has a little spoolie on the end to do some shaping,” Emma tells StyleCaster.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4484304932735><h2>Clear Brow Gel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/benefit-cosmetics-24-hour-brow-setting-clear-brow-gel-sephora.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=set-with-a-brow-gel><strong>Set with a brow gel</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve filled your brows and your color is firmly in place, follow up by combing through your arches with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brow gel</a> for another layer of hold. The gel will act as a barrier between your filled-in brows and water and sweat, so it’ll make your look virtually smudge-proof, too. Emma relies on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benefit Cosmetics’ 24-HR Brow Setter Clear Brow Gel with Lamination Effect</a>. “I love this product, and a lot of my friends use this one too,” she says. The clear formula shapes and tames eyebrows and locks them in place for up to 24 hours, per the brand. Check out the wand’s dual-sided design that helps coat every single brow hair. Oh, and don’t even worry about annoying crunchy flakes; this product leaves none of that behind.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.9456953642384><h2>Setting Spray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/now-solutions-rosewater-rejuvenating-face-mist-amazon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=finish-with-a-setting-spray><strong>Finish with a setting spray</strong></h2><p>No makeup is complete without a strong spritz of setting spray to pretty much guarantee that your brows aren’t going anywhere (or the rest of your makeup, for that matter). Our expert wholeheartedly agrees and has been loving the <a data-pmc-sp-product=afcb937291491599e7bf8a1243aa989f href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Rosewater Rejuvenating Mist","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"NOW Solutions Rosewater Rejuvenating Mist, Hydration and Rejuvenation Spray for All Skin and Hair Types, 4-Ounce","id":"B07TXKWYDW","category":"Face Care"},"id":1622614,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Rosewater Rejuvenating Mist</a> from NOW Solutions.</p><p>After this final step, Emma suggests avoiding wiping your face, especially while exercising. Instead, she recommends gently dabbing any sweat off. Another pointer from the Peloton instructor and author is to use less product when you’re being super active. This, along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sweat-proof makeup</a> you choose, will prevent your makeup from running.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfmsamrtGormarp5qutXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
