The support of family is something that makes someone feel a thousand times stronger and as if there is nothing else they can achieve in life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Alfonso Ribeiro, the host of ABC's America's Funniest Home Videos and a TV actor, is one lucky man to have such a wonderful family and married life.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Family Life Of Alfonso Ribeiro; Wife And Kids</h2><p>Alfonso Ribeiro is married to the lovely Angela Unkrich and has a great family. He has been happily wedded to her since their wedding in 2012. Although they have a great friendship, this isn't Alfonso's first rodeo.</p><p>In the year 2002, he married Robin Stapler. The two originally met in 1999 while filming the television show "In the House," and were instantly smitten. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They did not, however, stand the test of time. Alfonso and Robin decided to call it quits after four years of marriage when they divorced in 2006. Sienna, their daughter, was shared between them.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Alfonso&nbsp;Ribeiro's daughter Ava Sue on 15 May 2019 </strong>(Photo: Alfonso&nbsp;Ribeiro's Instagram)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But life goes on, and Alfonso's did as well. He has grown from his mistakes and now has a happy family. Alfonso Lincoln Ribeiro Jr. (born in 2013) and Anders Reyn Ribeiro (born in 2015) are the couple's boys, while Ava Sue is their daughter.</p><p>Ava is the newest member of their family. Her birthday is May 13th, 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The fact that having children in our lives strengthens our bonds with our partners ideally reflects his connection with his wife, as the two are endlessly in love with one another.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Another Couple With A Newborn:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Whitney Bischoff Pregnant, Husband, Bio</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Furthermore, the love he has for his children, as well as their shared love for their children, is exceptional. There's no substitute for the family! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Isn't it true that having such a lovely love life with his wife doesn't make him gay?</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>More On&nbsp;Alfonso Ribeiro:</h2><p>Alfonso Ribeiro, an American actor best known for his performance in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air starring Will Smith, was born on September 21, 1971, in The Bronx, New York. He went on to anchor the popular GSN game program Catch 21 as well as the controversial ABC show America's Funniest Home Videos.</p><p>His dancing abilities are also well-known, as he and his partner, Witney Carson, won the 19th season of Dancing With the Stars. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All of his accomplishments have garnered him all of the fame and money he has ever desired. His net worth is believed to be $7 million. No wonder he bought a huge house in the first place.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>The&nbsp;Granada Hills home&nbsp; Alfonso bought for&nbsp;$1,937,50 back in late 2016.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: latimes.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Speaking of his family background and his ethnicity, his parents are&nbsp;from Trinidad and Tobago, and although rumors there that he is of Dominica descent, he has falsified it himself.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Beef With A Videogame Company.</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Alfonso must have been shocked when he saw the dance he created “Carlton Dance” started trending after almost three decades. Fortnite, a game created by Epic Games, used the dance as a celebratory item in the game. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>In A Lawsuit:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>LeSean McCoy, Massive Salary & Net Worth Girlfriend Engaged</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Alfonso created the dance for an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;in 1991.
