However, the belt on her waist had other plans and caused her to have a wardrobe malfunction when it popped open and fell to the floor.</p><p>Gasping, the 33-year-old exclaimed: “I’m so sorry, that was so loud, my belt popped off.”</p><p>To the event, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> wore a long, luxurious-looking black coat over a white button-up shirt and black boots.

The star admitted <a href=#>it was the “most annoying” day of her life</a> after he was so excited to be leaving the house for the first time since being in quarantine due to the pandemic.</p><p>The Wonka star said: “By the time I got to set, I was buzz-ing. That was the day Jennifer said was the most annoying day of her life, working with me and Leo [DiCaprio].”</p><p>“Timothée was just excited to be out of the house, I think it was his first scene,” Jennifer later recalled. She went on to say that she was a “misery” on that particular day and that there was no bad blood. In fact, she called the two men “very nice.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-s-future-in-the-hunger-games>Jennifer’s future in The Hunger Games</h2><p>The mom-of-one starred in four of the hit Dystopian films as Katniss Everdeen, and has recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Variety that she would “totally” be up for reprising the role of The Girl on Fire.</p><p>“If Katniss ever could ever come back into my life, 100 percent,” she said.</p><p>However, a producer for the series has cast doubt. She said that it’s up to Suzanne Collins, who authored the books from which the films are adapted.</p><p>“If Suzanne has something to say, then she’ll write a book about it,” Nina said. However, she pointed out that she would be “thrilled” to work on something Katniss-centric again if given the opportunity.</p><p>“Honestly, as much as I love Katniss, I think her story is complete. And I think that Suzanne feels that her story is complete. But if that changes, and Suzanne has something she wants to say, and it involves Katniss, then I would be thrilled.</p><p>“But really any chance to be back in this world, and lead with Francis and Suzanne, I would take regardless of who it was about.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger ‘taking things slow’ with new girlfriend 35 years younger</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2d%2BcLbEp6WinpWneq2t1qucp5uVYrCwwsSrqmaekZiybrXNZp%2BoqqKkv26t0maqoZ1dqMKnssSrqmavkaexs7vBnmSmmZybwq%2Bv06Kmp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
