She was only five when she decided on modelling. “I was walking up and down the living room at home like it was a catwalk and my mum said, ‘So, you want to be a model then?’ And I thought yes, yes I do.” Now 21, and having secured lucrative jobs for Gucci and Adidas, as well as multiple magazine covers, she prides herself on ensuring that the fashion industry can no longer ignore disability.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There is room for improvement; I want to see more models like me – or just more of me!” she says, laughing. “I read fashion magazines growing up, but I never saw people who looked like me and it made me feel sad. We need more diversity and inclusivity out there in the world. Don’t ridicule people like me – take a risk.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I read fashion magazines growing up, but I never saw people who looked like me<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For all its talk of inclusivity, fashion has not been quick to embrace disability. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 15 per cent of people have some kind of disability, forming the world’s largest minority community. The adaptive-clothing market – apparel designed for disabled, mobility-impaired, and chronically ill people – <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/the%20state%20of%20fashion%202020%20navigating%20uncertainty/the-state-of-fashion-2020-final.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="is estimated to reach almost $400 billion by 2026" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">is estimated to reach almost $400 billion by 2026</a>, yet the industry is still not moving quickly enough to address their needs. Goldstein is among only a handful of models with a disability to be cast in a major campaign or catwalk show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyond optics, the behind-the-scenes work has been equally slow. It was only last year that Unhidden became the first adaptive clothing label to join the British Fashion Council. Goldstein is keen to stress that disabled people love clothes too. Ever since her older sister Amy first introduced her to the joy of dressing up, Goldstein has been a woman obsessed.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Master the Art: Leigh-Anne Pinnock on finding your voice" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hb-moa-thumb2-1628773726.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I love fashion times a billion,” she says emphatically. “Amy used to dress me up and try different make-up on me and I loved it. I love Marilyn Monroe too. She was a great dancer and she used to pose like me.” She was also underestimated, I say. “Exactly!” she exclaims.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Goldstein was diagnosed with Down’s Syndrome when she was born, and her family was told that she wouldn’t talk, walk or be able to live independently, but she defied the doctors. As a young girl, she fast developed a love of dance and drama and, from the age of five, started appearing in productions at the Royal Albert Hall and The Royal Opera House. Not everyone recognised her potential right away, and she still has to deal with the assumption that she is unable to communicate; people automatically talk to her mother rather than her. “At primary school, they didn’t believe in me,” she says. “The teachers treated me like I was stupid, but I didn’t let it get to me. I was very talkative and would get in trouble for non-stop talking. You just have to be yourself and carry on.” As a teenager, she used clothes as a tool for self-expression, and shopping became a preferred pastime. “[Clothes] made me feel more confident,” she says. “I love bright colours, pink, yellow… they make me feel happy and bright.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When she was 15, a family friend saw a television advert for Zebedee Management, an agency that celebrates disabled, visibly different, non-binary, and trans UK models, and suggested that Goldstein’s mother get in touch. She did and Ellie was promptly signed. What appealed to her about modelling? “The camera, of course!” she says. “But also the clothes and make-up. Modelling is a way of expressing my personality.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2020, she reached a milestone career moment when she became the star of Gucci's Unconventional Beauty campaign, the result of an Instagram scouting project. “It was an amazing and overwhelming day,” she recalls. “The hair, make-up and clothes were brilliant. When I finally saw those pictures, it felt weird because they really showcased my personality. To me, they proved that I’ll never give up and why it’s good to follow your dreams.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She’d love to model for Louis Vuitton (“I love their handbags – my sister has one and I borrow it all the time”) and dreams of more magazine covers. Her most recent job sees her join Motherland’s Anna Maxwell Martin and the former Doctor Who Jodie Whittaker in Comic Relief’s 2023 Red Nose Day campaign.

I feel proud to be part of it.”</p><img alt="ellie goldstein" title="Ellie Goldstein" width=2500 height=3675 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rnd23-tk-maxx-comic-relief-mmlm-ellie-goldstein-lr1-1676232326.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Goldstein in Comic Relief’s 2023 Red Nose Day campaign, modelling T-shirts available at TK Maxx</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Work aside, she’s studying performing arts at New City College in Redbridge, Essex, where she is currently in a musical production of the cult film Heathers. She also does hip-hop and contemporary dance classes because of “the vibes, the energy and the team”, and is obsessed with the television show Supernanny. In December, she turned 21 and celebrated with a family holiday in Gran Canaria. “We walked, went swimming and had lunch and dinner out,” she said. “It was a great birthday.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, Goldstein thinks it’s time to reevaluate how we define beauty. “It’s about your personality,” she says. “ My mum, dad and dance teacher are all all supportive, bubbly, kind, caring and honest people. That’s beautiful.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ellie Goldstein supports Red Nose Day, wearing a t-shirt from the collection of chari-tees, featuring designs from Mr Men and Little Miss, available at TK Maxx stores and online at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://tkmaxx.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=tkmaxx.com data-vars-ga-product-id=84b0e579-4396-44cc-b45b-64fa3959bb10 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://tkmaxx.com/ data-product-url=http://tkmaxx.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftkmaxx.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=22ebe7fd-c0c7-4c75-bc78-9e7e94485e14 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">tkmaxx.com</a> to raise money for Comic Relief.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1pcWxla395e8Slo6KdXZy8rbDSrZyipl2ivKWxy2agp6yVp8OqsdZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
