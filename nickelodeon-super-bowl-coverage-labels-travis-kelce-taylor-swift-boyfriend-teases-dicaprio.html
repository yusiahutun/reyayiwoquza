This season, <a href=#><strong>Nickelodeon</strong></a> offered up its own coverage of the game, complete with commentary from Spongebob and Patrick, and it proved to be must-see TV.</p><p>From poking fun at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=http://toofab.com/tags/leonardodicaprio><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a> to their ridiculous on-screen chryons failing to even give <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a> his own name, instead dubbing him "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=http://toofab.com/tags/taylorswift><strong>Taylor Swift's</strong></a> boyfriend," and burning the Kansas City Chiefs for how long it took them to score their first touchdown, it was unadulterated (because it's a kid's network) madness.</p><p>It wasn't all insanity, though, as the cartoon characters were joined by legitimate sports commentators Noah Eagle and Nate Burleson, who did a fine job calling the actual game. They were joined by voice actors Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke as Spongebob and Patrick, respectively.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Spongebob performs SWEET VICTORY to open the <a href=#>#SuperBowl</a> on Nickelodeon's broadcast<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yGvfRpftmh</a></p>‚Äî Lights, Camera, Barstool (@LightsCameraPod) <a href=#>February 11, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@LightsCameraPod</a><p>But, it wasn't the actors that viewers saw any time the camera cut to their control booth at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Instead, they were covered by augmented reality (AR) digital versions of their animated counterparts, completing the illusion. The digitizations even moved along with their live comments.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:01f3e5a9-51f5-49f9-ac63-6c21d27361f0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2adf6b4b-2ae7-4a11-91c3-74721437170b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ee/5by4/2024/02/12/eee10751704e4197ab8a0b485ea6ea57_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Every Must-See Commercial for Super Bowl LVIII</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>And they weren't the only animated characters brought to life with AR throughout the game. There were plenty of other Bikini Bottom residents present on the field and in the stands, including sideline reporting by Sandy Cheeks and attempted game interruptions by Plankton.</p><p>Super Bowl LVIII marked the fifth time Nickelodeon has broadcast live coverage of an NFL game, but the first time they'd tackled a Super Bowl. That previous experience, though, certainly showed as most of their on-screen antics played off effortlessly. They even managed to dump (digital) slime on the Kansas City Chiefs in the moment of their overtime victory -- and every other big moment in both endzones.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>spongebob yelling touchdown is killing meüò≠üò≠üò≠ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4xvrwiWhKg</a></p>‚Äî bella (@surferns) <a href=#>February 12, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@surferns</a><p>This Super Bowl was also the highest-profile Nickelodeon NFL coverage yet, with CBS's main coverage of the game even giving the broadcast a shout-out, along with a shot of Spongebob and Patrick sitting alongside their human counterparts up in their official announcer's booth.</p><p>All of that attention helped the broadcast go viral on social media as many fans found themselves enjoying the sillier take on the big game, as well as some of the unexpected moments of levity the two cartoon commentators offered live along the way.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6c15ce74-ec88-4286-a87a-ac07f7bdc768 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2adf6b4b-2ae7-4a11-91c3-74721437170b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8b/5by4/2024/02/12/8bab2a4b51454476908ca82811c27cb8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Show Taylor Swift' Trends as Some Fans Lose Their Minds She's at Super Bowl and on TV</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>One moment that went viral was a very gentle poke at DiCaprio's dating history, referring to the 49-year-old's seeming penchant for moving on from his girlfriends once they surpass 25 years of age. It's been a consistent pattern for so long that news of it apparently even reached Bikini Bottom.</p><p>DiCaprio came up during the broadcast as a random point of discussion with Eagle and Burleson. "Leonardo DiCaprio, 25," Spongebob said. He then added, in case that wasn't clear enough, "That's his dating history."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>SpongeBob makes a joke about Leonardo DiCaprio on the Nickelodeon <a href=#>#SuperBowl</a> stream.</p><p>‚ÄúLeonardo DiCaprio, 25!

Other moments that got fans chatting and sharing included Kelce being labeled only "Taylor Swift's Boyfriend" who is "Good at Football," as well as moments where Dora the Explorer pops up to explain the rules of the game. They even cut to fish-ified celebs in the crowd from Megan Thee Sturgeon to Billie Eelish and LePrawn James.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:13ba9f21-2e5d-442c-80b6-2f9962475862 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2adf6b4b-2ae7-4a11-91c3-74721437170b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f5/5by4/2024/02/12/f524350ace1843149d90a4e81ca6ea2d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Usher Blows Roof Off of Super Bowl with All-Star Halftime Show, Epic Roller Skate Performance</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some of Bikini Bottom's finest made their way to the Super Bowl ‚≠ê</p><p>üì∫: <a href=#>#SBLVIII</a> on Nickelodeon <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cXSRTedJFT</a></p>‚Äî NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>February 12, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@NFL</a><p>Corporate synergy likely played a part in Nickelodeon's coverage of the Super Bowl this year as both it and CBS are part of the Viacom conglomerate.
