<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-02-20>February 20, 2024</time></span></div><section class=summary>Liberty University football player Tajh Boyd died by suicide, a medical examiner has ruled.
Boyd, a 19-year-old freshman offensive lineman from Chesapeake, Virginia, died last week.
And as first reported by CBS 6 News and 10 WAVY, the&nbsp;Western District Medical Examiner Office determined that Boyd took his own life.
The medical examiner has since confirmed to DailyMail.com that Boyd died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Liberty coach Jamey Chadwell did not specifically say that Boyd had died by suicide, but confirmed that his death was not football-related. <a href=../../../../liberty-football-player-tajh-boyd-died-suicide-virginia-medical-examiner-reveals-head-coach-jamey-chadwell-remembers-19-year-old-giving-heart-lit-room-html.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../manila-bus-siege-survivor-feels-reborn-after-successful-taiwan.html>Manila bus siege survivor Yik Siu-ling reborn after surgery in Taiwan</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

But the 37-year-old hit out at the Hong Kong hospital responsible for previous, failed treatment of her shattered jaw and said she had never received a satisfactory explanation for what went wrong.
Yik underwent 33 operations in three years at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin, but problems with inflammation and bone abnormalities meant the jaw reconstruction work had to be reversed. <a href=../../../../manila-bus-siege-survivor-feels-reborn-after-successful-taiwan.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/blog/page/467/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
