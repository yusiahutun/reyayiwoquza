This was done to make it look as if The Equalizer was able to run quick enough to catch them, when it was actually because Woodward couldn’t run very fast.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the series, Woodward continued to work in both film and television. He appeared in the horror film&nbsp;The Appointment (1982); the ghost of a murderer in the black comedy&nbsp;Deadly Advice (1994); the 18th century patriarch of&nbsp;The House of Angelo (1997), and a lord in the action adventure&nbsp;The Abduction Club (2002).
