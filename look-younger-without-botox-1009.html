For some, laser treatments, wrinkle-filling injections, or a mini lift may go right onto the to-do list. But what if you don't want to go down that road? No problem. Read on for the tried-and-tested tips that will take years off your look.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Easy Makeup Tricks</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As tempting as it can be to skip the makeup, throw on sunglasses, and hope your lip color makes you look "done," Lancôme makeup artist Sandy Linter warns, "Less is less; less is <i>not</i> more." Linter, who has made up her fair share of celebrities, gives lessons to real women at New York's Rita Hazan Salon and says you don't have to spend hours to look terrific. "But if you're going to do just one thing, do your eyes. Nothing is more aging than wearing just lipstick." More expert tips:</p><ul data-node-id=7 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li><b>"Radiant skin is youthful skin," </b>says Pati Dubroff, a makeup artist for Dior who works with Gwyneth Paltrow and Sharon Stone. Use a luminizing primer like Sephora Base Primer ($18). "And stick to liquid or cream foundation, as powder can be drying," adds makeup artist Sam Fine, whose clients include Iman and Vanessa Williams. He likes Vincent Longo Liquid Canvas ($48.50). "Women can look washed out as they age, so make sure your foundation is not too pale. Lighter is not more natural," says Linter. It's easy to use too much, so pat a damp sponge into skin to pick up any excess, suggests Linter, who loves the sheer coverage of Patricia Wexler M.D. Daily Defense Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30 ($29.50). Set with powder only where you are oily.</li><li><b>Concealer is your friend. </b>"Use it not just to conceal redness but also to highlight," explains Fine. Try Yves Saint Laurent Touche éclat ($40). Brush or pat it under your eyes, blending it down so it fans out into the middle of your face. "It can be very aging if it sinks into wrinkles, so use as little as possible," says Linter.</li><li><b>Spend time on your eyes. </b>"Eyes are the area that show your age fastest," says Fine. "A touch of glowing shadow on the center of your lid and inner corner will instantly brighten your eyes," says Dubroff. "But avoid shimmer, which brings out texture like fine lines," notes Fine. Try Laura Mercier Matte Eye Colour shadows ($22 each). And to give your eyes a lift, line the top lash line with a brown pencil or shadow and highlight your brow bone, which adds a beautiful halo around the eye.</li><li><b>Always define your brows. </b>"Use a pencil in a tone slightly lighter than your hair color," says Dubroff, and blend well with a spool brush. Try Diorshow Brow Styler ($28).</li><li><b>Max out your lashes. </b>"A few individual false lashes create a youthful and wide-eyed look," says Fine. Try Ardell lashes ($4). Linter relies on tons of mascara: "Thickening mascara can weigh down thin lashes and cause clumps," so look for one that separates and curls, like Shiseido Perfect Mascara ($22). "And Latisse works!" insists Linter, who uses the prescription lash enhancer on herself.</li><li><b>Cream blush adds an instant glow. </b>"Apply it with a foundation brush so you can control where it goes," says Dubroff. We like Philosophy Healthy Cream Blush in Look on the Bright Side ($22.50). Oily skin or large pores? Use a powder instead. Try CoverGirl TruBlend Blush in Pure Romance ($8.47).</li><li><b>Lip liner can work miracles. </b>In your 40s, the sides of your top lip lose fullness, explains Linter. Use a neutral lip pencil to softly round the outer corners of the lips and soften the Cupid's bow. Try Elizabeth Arden Lip Definer in Naturel ($16). Apply a clear silicone formula like Mally Beauty Lip Fence ($12.50) along the outer edge of your lip contour. "This fills in lines and acts as a barrier for lipstick leaks," says Dubroff. A satin-finish lipstick will add moisture and give good coverage. Linter likes Lancôme L'Absolu Rouge in Rich Cashmere ($29). Says Fine, "Anything that's rosy or beigey is most flattering." Another good pick: Giorgio Armani Rouge d'Armani in No. 19 ($30).</li></ul><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Glowing, Smooth Skin</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pros agree: Must-haves are sunscreen, an exfoliant, and an antioxidant product. "Skin is a renewable organ, and you can definitely slow the aging process," says Tammy Fender, owner of Tammy Fender Holistic Skin Care in West Palm Beach, Florida. "With a regimen, you can see a 30 to 40 percent improvement in two to three weeks," adds Neal Schultz, a New York dermatologist. More tips:</p><ul data-node-id=13 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li><b>Use SPF 30. It not only protects, it makes skin look younger. </b>"The skin has an incredible ability to heal itself once you start blocking UVA and UVB rays. You'll see an improvement in both texture and tone," notes Chanel Jenae, co-owner of Arcona Studio in Los Angeles, where Scarlett Johansson and Michelle Pfeiffer get treatments. Try Olay Pro-X Age Repair Lotion with SPF 30 ($42).</li><li><b>Use an antioxidant serum or moisturizer. </b>"Vitamin C is the best," says Schultz, "but apply it at night because it's sun sensitive." Vitamin C will brighten the skin, and it helps with skin damage and melasma. Other antioxidants to look for: vitamin E, resveratrol, and green tea. Try Tammy Fender Essential C Tonic ($55). Products with firming ingredients like red algae can also help. We like Chanel Ultra Correction Lift Concentrate ($165).</li><li><b>Use some form of retinol. </b>"You'll notice a real transformation with this ingredient," says Jenae. It smooths wrinkles, retexturizes, boosts collagen, and lightens spots. Try Arcona Vitamin A Complex ($68).</li><li><b>"Exfoliation is pivotal to facial rejuvenation,"</b> explains Schultz. "Ultimately, it increases dermal volume, making skin look less wrinkly." It will also help brown spots. You can use a physical exfoliant, like a scrub, or a chemical exfoliant, such as a glycolic peel. Your dermatologist or facialist can advise which is best for you. We like Rodial Glamtox Peel ($90).</li><li><b>Eat a healthy diet. </b>"Your skin reflects what you eat. Chemicals and processed foods are toxic to your cells and cause degeneration, making you look older. Your skin is an eliminating organ, and if you've got a poor diet, your complexion will show it," says Fender, who recommends plenty of fresh fruit and veggies to help alleviate dull skin.</li></ul><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Gorgeous, Bouncy Hair</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't believe that you have to cut your hair at a certain age. You just have to keep it flattering to your face," says Mark Townsend, Matrix celebrity stylist and Reese Witherspoon's mane man. More expert tips:</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li><b>Consider face-framing layers, </b>which will give you a lift and "emphasize your bone structure," explains New York stylist Oscar Blandi, who works with Jennifer Garner. "And adding bangs can distract from forehead lines."</li><li><b>A bob is a flattering look, </b>and you can adjust the length depending on your hair type.</li><li><b>Be realistic about your hair texture. </b>Are your locks thin and scraggly? Then stay on the shorter side. "Length should be based on the thickness of your hair," says Blandi. If you've got long and thick hair, flaunt it.</li><li><b>Keep your hair away from your face, </b>suggests stylist Tippi Shorter, who coifs Rihanna. "When you pull hair back, it draws the eye up and away so you look younger. You don't have to cut it, but give it volume on top." Tease the roots and spritz Ojon Swa+ Instant Hold Hairspray ($27) to keep it in place.</li></ul><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Shiny, Luminous Hair Color</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Your color needs to be simple but current," explains Amanda George, colorist and co-owner of L.A.'s Neil George Salon, where Cameron Diaz is often spotted. To look younger, "never go too dark around the hairline," advises colorist Sharon Dorram, co-owner of her own New York salon and color guru to Kate Hudson and Linda Evangelista. "You need softness around your face or you'll look severe." More expert tips:</p><ul data-node-id=26 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li><b>Don't go too blonde. </b>You must keep depth in the blonde, so ask for both highlights and lowlights, says George.</li><li><b>The right highlights can light up your face. </b>"For a quick boost, we do T-zone highlighting, which highlights along the hairline and the part, then follow it with a high-shine gloss," says George. "It adds instant brightness."</li><li><b>Gray can be fabulous. </b>Got salt and pepper? "Bring out the salt and make it sparkle so it looks glamorous," says Dorram. Adds George, "Gray hair can get dehydrated. I recommend Rene Furterer Okara Silver Shampoo [$23]."</li><li><b>Avoid products with alcohol. </b>"Alcohols can dull color," explains Dorram, so use color-preserving products like Nexxus Dualiste Color Protection + Intense Hydration Shampoo ($11.99) and Conditioner ($15.70).</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAna2im5VkrnV%2Bl2ijqKebYsawwc2gnKtlp57BqbvUrWSbp6SkxW59j2lwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
