This channel will bring you such an unusual video," he correctly captioned the video.</p><p>He went on to explain that the footage was filmed in 2022 as part of a feature he did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>with German TV station RTL</strong></a>. Only some of the video made air and he was later granted permission to post behind-the-scenes footage from the shoot to his own page.</p><p>"So I am releasing them to the public! On the day of the interview, they were very kind to me. Thank you very much," he added.</p><p>He previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MailOnline</strong></a> that he wanted to be an animal and had a "desire to transform" since he was a child.</p><p>"I thought a big animal close to my size would be good considering that it would be a realistic model, so I decided to make it a dog," he explained, noting that collies are his favorite breed. He also noted that when he wears it, he has to be careful about his movements or else "it will not look like a dog."</p><p>While he's posted a bunch of videos in his fur-lined get up, he's continued to hide his true identity &nbsp;-- telling the outlet he does not want his "hobbies to be known" to his coworkers.</p><p>"They think it's weird that I want to be a dog," he said. "For the same reason why I can't show my real face."</p><p>The costume was made by Japanese company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Zeppet</strong></a>, a special effects studio which typically works with movies, commercials and amusement facilities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma29foq6vedahpmaroJq7tXmQbqJmp55iv6aty6KqraGTYrGws4ycpqyspaKybsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
