Now, a former butler of the household has said they could ask <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> to return to the royals, for him to pull up his sleeves to help out – but they just need to ask. He claims, as the <a href=#>king steps back for cancer treatment</a>, and <a href=#>Kate Middleton’s absence</a> fuels conspiracy theories, the family are running out of options. That is, unless they pick up the phone to call H (as <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> calls him).</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royal-family-face-crisis>Royal family face ‘crisis’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1235558219-1024x683.jpg><p>Grant Harrold, who worked for <a href=#>King Charles III</a> and Queen Camilla for eight years, says the current state of the royals is a “constitutional disaster”, and only Prince Harry could help, if he ever returns.</p><p>“It’s an absolute constitutional disaster right now,” he said on behalf of <a href=# rel=nofollow>SpinGenie</a>.</p><p>Harrold added: “We’ve got the poor King, the new <a href=#>Queen</a> – and the reality is the popularity polls have shown she’s not that popular – obviously no one is as popular as the late Queen. She’s had to step up to the mark, and it’s a lot for a 76-year-old to take on.</p><p>“You’ve got a Princess of Wales that has vanished, Prince Harry and Meghan, who obviously have issues with the family.</p><p>“The royal family is definitely in a crisis for the first time.</p><p>“I don’t think there ever has been a situation this bad.”</p><p>He believes fans would forgive the Duke, who moved across the Atlantic to live in his <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> with his family in 2020. Meghan Markle and Harry made the decision to move away with their son <a href=#>Prince Archie</a> over their safety and privacy. They later welcomed Princess <a href=#>Lilibet</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-not-unreasonable-to-ask-prince-harry-to-return-to-the-royals>‘It’s not unreasonable to ask Prince Harry to return to the royals’</h2><p>Harrold believes asking Harry to return to help the royals wouldn’t be out of the question, considering Prince William and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> struggling with the spotlight and conspiracy theories over the past month.</p><p>He said: “Part of me is thinking, will they bite the bullet and say to Harry, ‘We need you to come back to help your brother with undertaking duties again’. He’s not a working member of the royal family, but he is a senior member of the royal family.</p><p>“As such, at this point in time, with everything going wrong, it’s not unreasonable to ask if he would.”</p><p>He added: “I don’t see any reason why Prince Harry couldn’t return as a full working royal. He’s fifth in line to the throne.</p><p>“God forbid, if something happened that wiped out William’s family, it is <a href=#>Harry and Meghan</a>.</p><p>“That’s what people forget, they are the next step at this moment in time. On that front, he is a significant member of the family, it will be a long time before that changes. As fifth in line to the throne, as Counsel of the State, as the son of the King, as the brother of the future King, you would think he would step in and come in to actually help.”</p><p>The ex butler believes fans wouldn’t have a problem of the prince rolling up his sleeves.</p><p>“I don’t think people could be unhappy about [Harry returning] because, at the end of the day, he’s doing it for his father, and I think they’d be wrong to complain about it,” Harrold continued. “I think the issue might be, people think, what if he’s doing it for his own ends…”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duke-crisis-can-unite-families>Duke: ‘Crisis can unite families’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1233751240-1-1024x769.jpg><p>It comes after the Duke of Sussex broke his silence over his <a href=#>father’s cancer diagnosis</a> last month.</p><p>The 39-year-old spoke to <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> in a recent appearance and said he <a href=#>flew back to the UK</a> “as soon as he was told” about his father’s health.</p><p>He added he wanted to see his family “as much as he can”, saying he loves his family.</p><p>The dad-of-two said: “The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I’m grateful for that.”</p><p>Harry hinted at a possible reconciliation in The Firm, after a turbulent five years. He said: “I think any illness, any sickness, brings families together.”</p><p>Tensions within the palace grew tense after he began dating Meghan, a former TV star.</p><p>The prince wrote in his memoir Spare, claiming his brother <a href=#>Prince William</a> pushed him to the ground in an argument. The celebrity couple also spoke about difficult times they had when they were working royals in a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2d%2BcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2Galnp2UqHq1u4yrnK2toqN6tbuMrZ%2BeZaKkxqK40maYrGWknbK6ecWamp5lk6S7tMDIraytoZ%2Bjrq15wqugrKGjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
