Her quirky personality has won fans over up until the moment the season concluded. Now, fans are going crazy on social media over the <a href=#>season 11 reunion</a> trailer. The clip promised so much drama that Bravo has decided to divide up this epic event into four parts — and Kathy is bringing receipts.</p><h2 id=h-kathy-hilton-joined-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-as-a-friend-in-season-11>Kathy Hilton joined ‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’ as a friend in season 11</h2><p id=par-3_49>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fans are extremely familiar with <a href=#>Kyle Richards</a> and her sister Kim. Kyle is the only remaining OG cast member who’s been on the reality series since day one. And Kim was both a series regular and a friend of the show for 10 seasons.</p><p id=par-4_49>But it wasn’t until season 11 that their oldest sister, Kathy Hilton, finally decided to make her RHOBH debut as a friend of the show. Why did she wait so long? According to the mom of Paris and <a href=#>Nicky Hilton</a>, she was “hurt” by Kyle’s behavior in season 1.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_44>While chatting with Bruce Bozzi during a recent appearance on Radio Andy, Kathy revealed that she stopped talking to Kyle after her and Kim’s infamous limo incident in season 1 of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She also stopped watching the Bravo reality show.</p><p id=par-6_28>“I didn’t watch it because I was so hurt at what happened that first season and I didn’t speak to my sister for a long time,” Kathy admitted.</p><h2 id=h-the-season-1-rhobh-limo-altercation-left-kathy-in-tears>The season 1 ‘RHOBH’ limo altercation left Kathy in tears</h2><p id=par-7_46>Fans may recall the season 1 incident when Kim famously accused Kyle of stealing a house from her sisters. Kim screamed her accusation at Kyle from the back of a stretch limo, and Kyle responded with an epic death stare before outing Kim as an alcoholic.</p><p id=par-8_36>Kyle told Kim, “Mom had to die worrying about you and stressing over you…You’re a liar and sick and an alcoholic.” Kathy says that she and Paris watched the episode, and it left them in tears.</p><p id=par-9_73>“Paris and I watched that, we broke down… You know when you cry and you’re shaking and your lip starts to quiver and my mommy’s not there and there’s no one… It’s like, I felt helpless and low and Paris was crying too,” Kathy recalled. “I can’t [watch the show anymore]. Really, I don’t watch. And if I did watch that first season, I would only zip quickly to see Kim and Kyle.”</p><h2 id=h-kathy-hilton-brought-receipts-to-the-season-11-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-reunion>Kathy Hilton brought receipts to the season 11 ‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’ reunion</h2><p id=par-10_45>Kathy and Kyle feuded for years over more than just Kyle’s behavior in season 1. But they finally reconciled in the months leading up to season 11. That cleared the way for Kathy to join the Bravo series, and she quickly became a fan favorite.</p><p id=par-11_37>After taping her first reunion, Kathy said she wasn’t scared for the season-ending sit down. But, she thought it would be best to bring receipts just in case things got wild. Of course, that’s exactly what happened.</p><p id=par-12_22>“I wasn’t frightened,” Kathy told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live. “It was very interesting, it was wild. It was wild.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_24>When Andy noted that Kathy had “brought a list of receipts” with her to the taping, he said that was something he “really enjoyed.”</p><p id=par-14_50>“You know why?” Kathy asked as Kyle laughed. “Because everybody thought that I just didn’t show up to Garcelle’s party. And I was told not to because I had not been feeling well. And I am not an impolite person and I adore her and I have manners, dammit all.”</p><h2 id=h-she-joined-the-bravo-series-because-she-was-bored>She joined the Bravo series because she was bored</h2><p id=par-15_42>Kathy admits that because of what went down between Kyle and Kim in the first season of RHOBH, her daughters were shocked when she decided to join the Bravo series in season 11. But her husband Rick and her sons were supportive.</p><p id=par-16_36>She says that a number of things prompted her to join the cast, including the fact that she was bored. But most importantly, she knew the show would give her a platform for her business ventures.</p><p id=par-17_52>“I was bored, I wanted to spend time with Kyle. [And] I also thought, ‘You know what? I’m a businesswoman and there’s things that I would like to do in the future.’ And you know what? When you have some eyeballs on you, I’m being very honest, it doesn’t hurt,” she noted.</p><h2 id=h-kathy-hilton-is-ready-to-return-for-season-12-of-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills>Kathy Hilton is ready to return for season 12 of ‘Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’</h2><p id=par-18_41>So, was one season enough for Kathy? Or, will she be back for season 12. The RHOBH star said during an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show that she will return for another season if she is invited to do so.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-19_38>“Well we first have to see if I’m invited back,” Kathy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>. “About two weeks after the reunion, we find out if we’re invited back. I mean, I would love to. I really had a lot of fun.”</p><p id=par-20_16>The season 11 Real Housewives of Beverly Hills four-part reunion begins Wednesday, Oct. 13, on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvBoWSerpWjeqyt06GwZqCZocGwuoybqaKml567qHnRnpqeoaCpwG6xz6KaZmxdpa6zwIysnJqrn6N6cn2Mq5yuppmku2%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
