The trial of two homicides in the Murdaugh family has dragged attention toward the only surviving and free member of the family, Buster. Is he married? How old is he now? Where does she live?</p><p>Keep scrolling down to find all the answers below.</p><h3><strong>Meet Buster Murdaugh, Alex Murdaugh Son</strong></h3><p>Richard Alexander “Buster” Murdaugh is the oldest of two sons of attorney Alex Murdaugh and his wife late <a href=#>Maggie Murdaugh</a>. His father is currently on a trial for the murder of his brother and his mom in June 2021. Jurors were told by the prosecutor, Creighton Waters, how Murdaugh shot his kid with buckshot first before picking up an AR-15-style gun and killing his wife, Maggie, twice in the head.</p><p>‘It was a family weapon that killed Maggie Murdaugh,’ Creighton said.</p><p>The Greenville News brought into light the plethora of witnesses related to Alex’s trial and Buster was one of them. However, he had also been in legal trouble before that also involved his late brother and his dad.</p><p>Mallory Beach, 19, lost her life on February 24, 2019, when Paul “drunkenly crashed his boat into a bridge,” according to WTOC. Several hours before the collision, Paul allegedly purchased alcohol from a gas station using Buster’s ID. The Beach family sued Paul, Buster, Maggie Murdaugh’s estate, and Parker’s gas station a month after their daughter passed away.</p><p>A judge authorized a settlement in January 2023 for an unspecified sum. The removal of Buster and Maggie from the lawsuit was in return for this action.</p><p>In the South Carolina Lowcountry’s legal community, the Murdaugh name is well-known. In addition to obtaining several multimillion-dollar settlements for fatal accidents and industrial injuries, Alex Murdaugh worked for a family law company that had been operating in the little nearby Hampton County for a century.</p><p>For 87 years in a row in Colleton, Hampton, and three additional counties, Murdaugh’s father, grandpa, and great-grandfather held elected prosecutor positions. Usually, Murdaugh’s father’s portrait is displayed in the Colleton County Courthouse. It was ordered to be moved for his son’s trial by Judge Clifton Newman.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Buster Murdaugh Now?</strong></h3><p>Buster Murdaugh who has been dragged into the spotlight after the two homicides in his family keeps himself away from the spotlight.</p><p>A former college classmate of Buster revealed to People Magazine in July 2021 that the oldest son of Alex wasn’t doing well at all. They added, “He really withdrew after everything happened. Before, he’d text immediately. His phone was surgically implanted in his hand or something like you’d send a text 24/7 and he’d respond, and he loved to chat. Now he doesn’t respond to most texts or, if he does, it’s one or two words. He has really closed off and built walls around himself.”</p><p>During his father’s trial, Buster sat still and silently behind his father in the Colleton County Courthouse during the opening remarks in his first public appearance during his father’s legal proceedings. In November 2022, DailyMail revealed that Buster angrily rejected the claim that he was “supporting his father.”</p><p>Since his mother and brother were shot dead at the family’s former hunting estate of Moselle, Islandton, on June 7, 2021, Buster has been quiet while his once-famous family’s fortunes have fallen into disgrace.</p><p>But, he responded when DailyMail reached out. He explained, “Presumably you’re supporting your father?” he replied, “You have no right to presume anything.” And he was adamant as he said, “I don’t want to see it written anywhere that I’m supporting my father.”</p><p>When asked if he wanted to comment further on his father’s guilt or innocence, Buster simply answered, “I have no interest in saying anything. I have no comment.”</p><p>A childhood friend of his has also stated he’s “collateral damage” to his father’s alleged actions. “His circle of friends got really small really fast… He’s really down…,” the friend said. “He doesn’t make eye contact and he doesn’t really engage like he used to. He looks tired. He’s aged like 10 years in the past year. He has bags under his eyes and he just looks miserable. It’s just a shame.”</p><h3><strong>Buster Murdaugh Age</strong></h3><p>During the time of the ongoing trial in 2023, Buster Murdaugh is currently 26 years old.</p><h3><strong>Buster Murdaugh Job</strong></h3><p>The Wall Street Journal had previously reported that Buster was allegedly kicked out of South Carolina Law School.

Buster is in a longtime relationship with his girlfriend <a href=#>Brooklynn White</a>. They share a modest $180K condo together on Hilton Head Island.</p><p>At the time, one neighbor described the pair as a “really nice couple” and always “smile and say hi.” The dating couple also reportedly has a dog named Miller.</p><p>But, they aren’t married so no, Buster doesn’t have a wife yet. Brooklynn is currently 26 years old. She is working as an attorney. She received her law degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law.
