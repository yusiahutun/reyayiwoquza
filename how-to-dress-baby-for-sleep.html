Baby sleeping bags advise what tog to use for each season or temperature, so that can be handy to use as a guide."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ea740193222-baby-feet-close-up.jpg><p id=exXVG8qeAN7 data-wc=78>She continues: "However, every baby is different, and it's important to keep an eye on them for signs of overheating. Feel your baby's chest or the back of their neck (your baby's hands and feet will usually be cooler, which is normal). If their skin is hot or sweaty, remove one or more layers of bedclothes or bedding. In really hot weather it's fine for your baby to sleep in a short sleeve vest or just a nappy."</p><h2>What should baby wear to sleep in the winter?</h2><p id=eSMrf-DhNdub data-wc=61>"We know that the colder months can be difficult for families and we understand it can be tempting to wrap your baby up to keep them warm while they sleep. However, we know that overheating increases the chances of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and research shows that it's better for babies to be cooler rather than too hot."

While it can be tempting to use extra layers or heating to keep your baby warm, you should never place their cot directly next to a radiator or have another heat source, like a portable heater, directly aimed at them. Babies are unable to regulate their temperature, so may get too hot and are unable to move out of the way of the heat source.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/069cfa6c8af2-gro-egg-z.jpg><p id=eydTFyuQs_sp data-wc=8><strong>Tommee Tippee Groegg Digital Room Thermometer, £30, <span><a aria-label=groegg class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Argos</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label=groegg class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=e_I1PWFefr4j data-wc=15><strong>For more information on creating a safe sleep environment for babies visit <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Lullaby Trust</a>.</strong></p><p id=eekI098wf06x data-wc=22><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to the HELLO!
