Hopping back to the BBC she popped up in <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>EastEnders</a> in July 2006 as Gemma Clewes, Max Branning's mistress.

Natalie played Grace in the movie which follows cooks in a Glasgow kitchen as they deal with the pressures of the job.</p><p>An ex-criminal Danny (James Young) then joins the restaurant where he ends up having an affair with his probation officer’s wife Grace, played by Natalie. As expected things end badly with a ton of drama packed within its run-time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>In the flick, Natalie went totally topless as her beau Danny in the movie performed a sex act on her.

And this time, they took part in a raunchy romp in the back of the restaurant in the store room.</p><p>After her stint in BBC's Waterloo road Natalie landed her most prominent TV role in Emmerdale as Moira Barton – the feisty character we all know and love today. In 2009 she joined the soap as the head of new farming family, the Bartons. With Natalie making her Emmerdale debut on our screens in July.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32195395.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Emmerdales-Moira-star-went-topless-for-x-rated-sex-scene-before-soap-fame-WEEKEND.jpg><p>Natalie was previously dated <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Emmerdale</a> co-star, Jonny McPherson, who plays hunky Doctor Liam Cavanagh in the ITV soap.

We come from quite different backgrounds but we are essentially the same person. We are both a pair of big kids. We have exactly the same stupid humour."</p><p>The two Emmerdale actors announced they had parted ways last summer in 2021. Since calling it quits, Jonny has reportedly moved into his own boat with his dog Molly.</p><p><b>Emmerdale airs weeknights on ITV1 and ITVX at 7.30pm</b></p><p><b>Want all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox? </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlonKallaexorjErGSmp5mnrm6wyKeepZ1dqMGivoywnKesXWh%2FcoWUaW9p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
