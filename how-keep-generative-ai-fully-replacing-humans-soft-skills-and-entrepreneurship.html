How should humans respond to generative AI?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One thing that is difficult for AI to do – and something at which humans excel – is entrepreneurialism. This includes the ability to plan, muddle through and mobilise people and resources to create new ventures to achieve certain goals. AI cannot do these things, at least for the foreseeable future.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/03/clean-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:22</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">AI robot conductor makes debut leading South Korea’s national orchestra</p><p>AI robot conductor makes debut leading South Korea’s national orchestra</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Entrepreneurialism covers at least three types of skills. First is problematisation, or asking the right question and framing a problem in a way that inspires solutions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Problematisation is a skill that helps us identify gaps, tensions, inconsistencies, patterns, dilemmas and so on and makes a solution easier to craft and implement. It is also a relevant skill in prompt engineering as it helps to better solve problems and spot opportunities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But its effectiveness also depends on idiosyncratic prior knowledge and insights on issues that require context-specific understandings. Effective problematisation also requires lots of practice.</p>Moreover, the problematisation of existing practices or realities typically requires superior creative abilities and insights that cannot be <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">replicated by AI machines</span></a>. This skill rests on a wealth of tacit understandings that are not even articulated in the language-based forms of communication simulated by AI technologies.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">AI is rewriting the rules of creativity. Should it be stopped?</span></p></a></h3>Second is organising. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Generative AI</span></a> cannot, at least for the foreseeable future, organise people, ideas or resources and use language to persuade others and mobilise them to achieve goals. This is where humans excel and can exceed generative AI.Organising also comes with a set of moral, religious and cultural values and knowing one’s passion, mission and identity, something AI doesn’t have. Organising cannot be performed by <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">large language models</span></a> such as ChatGPT because it requires skills unique to humans and involves our emotion, judgment and ability to relate to other humans.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Importantly, our moral judgments and ability to exercise empathy and connect with others are essential for more than the entrepreneurial method.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Third is multiple specialisation. Single-skill specialisation is no longer sustainable. Rather, workers in the age of AI will have to embrace an array of specialised skills and have multiple interests as a survival mechanism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An accountant or lawyer will need computational skills and knowledge of criminology or psychology. A copy writer will need multiple foreign languages and animation skills. An engineer will need tools from the arts, philosophy and economics. The maxim “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” rings truer than ever.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Generative AI takes entrepreneurial learning and the opportunity to master a variety of subjects to a whole new level. In fact, the ability to learn widely in close collaboration with generative AI could become the most important tool for entrepreneurial individuals.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">ChatGPT will soon hear and talk, allowing it to chat more like a human</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This means the education system could need to shift towards multiple majors that place a stronger focus on skills as opposed to subjects. Entrepreneurship will no longer be constrained as a specialist subject in business schools.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, we could entertain the idea of entrepreneurialism as a mandatory discipline akin to languages, maths or programming. We are already in an era when entrepreneurialism is something for all learners and workers. Yet, the new reality defined by the rise of AI means entrepreneurialism is no longer just an opportunity to excel – it is a survival skill.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/06/06/clean-thumb_2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:19</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Is AI better at maths than mathematicians?</p><p>Is AI better at maths than mathematicians?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smartphones are an extension of our body. AI will soon become a more radical extension of our artificial ways of understanding the world and ourselves in it. Calculators made mathematical skills obsolete in the workplace. Google made the memorisation of libraries of information largely unnecessary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">AI has removed the need for cognitive tasks that can now be performed faster and more efficiently by intelligent machines. Even so, we remain optimistic that the entrepreneurial method is one of the few aspects of human intelligence that can never be replaced by AI. Entrepreneurialism, a set of skills and mindsets as old as human civilisation, could come to our aid in this AI-driven crisis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Dr Yanto Chandra is an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Dr Stratos Ramoglou is a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Southampton Business School</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlsbmdtgHC0zrBkpJ2VpXqosc2eqZqsmauybq3IZp2upJyuerOxz6WYnKGenHqpwcyapaxlo6SztXnSpKClpKNirq%2BwjJ6lraqVpb%2BmusSuqaygmaU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
