Nevertheless, creativity was used in the adaptation from book to film. Is <i>Moneyball</i> based on a true story? Here are some aspects of the movie that are true and false:</p><h3>True</h3><p class=align-left>The movie accurately portrays the Athletics' emphasis on sabermetrics, an advanced statistical analysis of baseball data, to evaluate players and build a competitive team on a limited budget.</p><p class=align-left>The film accurately depicts Beane's history as a promising baseball prospect pursuing a career in front-office management instead of playing professionally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d217a6c6d88a318c.jpg><p class=align-left>The character of Peter Brand is based on Paul DePodesta, an assistant general manager under Beane during the period covered in the movie. DePodesta was responsible for much of the A's analytical approach but left after the 2004 season.</p><p class=align-left>The movie shows the Athletics signing players like Scott Hatteberg, Chad Bradford, and David Justice, who were undervalued by other teams but went on to contribute significantly to the A's success.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cff5d0f3e8c9d18.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Building Alaska cast members profiles and other TV roles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The movie accurately represents the Athletics' historic 20-game winning streak during the 2002 season and their subsequent defeat in the playoffs.</p><h3>False</h3><p class=align-left><i>Moneyball</i> portrays Peter Brand as a recent Yale graduate with no professional baseball experience, which is inaccurate. Paul DePodesta had an economics background and baseball operations experience.</p><p class=align-left>Scott Hatteberg is shown as a first baseman who struggles to adapt to the position after being signed by the Athletics. In reality, Hatteberg was primarily a catcher before joining the A's, and he did not switch to first base until later in his career.</p><p class=align-left>The movie depicts Billy Beane's relationship with his daughter as more strained than in real life. But based on <i>Moneyball</i> cast vs real-life, the real-life Beane has stated that he maintains a close relationship with his daughter.</p><p class=align-left>His daughter was still a teenager during the period covered in the movie. The movie simplifies the contract negotiations between the Athletics and players, sometimes omitting key details or combining multiple events into a single scene.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/17de77a95f162725.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 soccer movies on Netflix that you should watch in 2023</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The film shows Beane as having reservations about remaining with the Athletics due to their limited budget. In reality, Beane chose to stay with the team, believing that their developed analytical approach could continue to yield results.</p><h2>Did the Oakland A's win 20 in a row?</h2><p class=align-left>The Oakland A's won 20 consecutive games between 13 August and 4 September 2002, setting an American League record. The streak is well-documented and considered one of baseball's most remarkable achievements.</p><p class=align-left>The team's 20th consecutive win came on 4 September 2002 against the Kansas City Royals, with Scott Hatteberg hitting a walk-off home run. The feat was part of the 2002 Oakland Athletics season, during which they won 103 games and secured the American League MVP.</p><h2>What happened to Billy Beane after <i>Moneyball</i>?</h2><p class=align-left>After <i>Moneyball</i>, Billy Beane remained the Oakland Athletics general manager until 2015.
