No matter what I do or buy, the puffiness and circles seem to come back. After trying many expensive products with big promises and little results, I’ve been on the search to find the best DIY eye creams I can make at home.</p><p>While I’ll always be up for putting <a href=#>new products</a> to the test or <a href=#>trying natural solutions</a>, I wanted to find some cost-effective options I can make to give me positive results on a regular basis. Here are five recipes I’ve tried that I plan on working into my regular routine.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Honey Bee Eye Cream&nbsp;</h2><p>This recipe is filled with wonderful, natural ingredients, which each have special benefits all on their own. You have four ingredients total — three spoonfuls of shea butter, two spoonfuls of melted beeswax, a spoonful of honey, and then a few drops of lavender oil. The honey will help lighten dark circles under your eyes. Beeswax and shea butter are both good for wrinkles because they help stimulate collagen that encourages firmness. The aroma of lavender oil is great to encourage relaxation.&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure to mix all ingredients well. With the honey, you might have to stir a bit to get a smooth consistency. For a power treatment, put a thick layer under your eyes for at least 10 minutes before wiping clean. You can also apply a thin layer overnight, and you should notice a tightness by the next morning. You can easily adjust the recipe up or down as needed. Just keep the ratio in mind of 3-2-1 for the main ingredients.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cucumber Aloe Eye Cream&nbsp;</h2><p>People have been putting cucumbers under their eyes for years. Even <a href=#>Bette Davis used this trick </a>to keep her famous eyes in their best shape. Experts say cucumbers work well for de-puffing eyes and nourishing them in general. But now you can take this treatment to the next level with this recipe.&nbsp;</p><p>Start with a couple of spoonfuls of aloe vera, which is often recommended for dark circles and bags under eyes. Add the liquid from one capsule of Vitamin E — a natural wrinkle fighter —and mix well. Then take thin slices of cucumbers and dip them in this mixture. Apply directly to the under eye area for 10-20 minutes. (You might have to lie down.) This is like having two eye treatments in one!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Avocado Lemon Eye Cream&nbsp;</h2><p>Like cucumbers, avocados are popular for putting directly on and under the eye. They are rich in vitamin E and are good for helping the skin’s elasticity. Lemon is also popular, especially for helping with dark circles. So for this recipe, combine the two, along with some almond oil, which has retinol, vitamin E, and vitamin K.&nbsp;</p><p>To make your own mixture, start with half an avocado, mashed well. Then squeeze the juice from half a lemon and add a few drops of almond oil. After mixing well, apply it to your under eye area for at least 15 minutes. It’ll freshen you right up!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Orange Coconut Eye Cream&nbsp;</h2><p>There are so many <a href=#>great uses for coconut oil</a>, including several for overall beauty and wellness. Coconut oil has natural anti-inflammatory benefits, and it’s great for both dark circles and puffiness. You can use it alone, applying it directly to your skin to see these benefits. Or it also makes a great base for creating your own DIY eye creams.&nbsp;</p><p>For this recipe, start with a few large spoonfuls of coconut oil. You might pop the oil into the microwave for a quick 30 seconds to get it a little melty and a good consistency for mixing. Then add the contents of one vitamin E capsule, along with the juice of half an orange. (If you don’t have an orange, you can also use a couple of drops of orange essential oil.) Mix it together well, and then apply under your eyes for at least 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chai Gelatin Eye Pads&nbsp;</h2><p>You know the under eye gel patches and collagen pads you can buy? It’s easy to make your own with just a few items, starting with the key ingredient gelatin. You can find unscented and unflavored gelatin in the baking aisle of your grocery store. This will be your base for this recipe — just follow the instructions on the box while substituting the liquid in the recipe with tea instead. I used a vanilla chai for my recipe, but you could use any tea or coffee as long as it has caffeine. This is the key ingredient to help reduce inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have the tea mixed with the gelatin, pour into a pan or a plate to create a thin layer, and then refrigerate for a few hours. (Make sure your layer isn’t too thick because it’ll make it hard to cut and to stay on the eyes.) Once you pull it out, use a butter knife to cut a shape that will fit under your eyes. Then apply and relax for a bit as the gelatin and tea work their magic. Store any unused gelatin in a sealed container in the refrigerator, and use as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you can reach for one of these simple DIY eye creams to de-puff, reduce fine lines, and save a few bucks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomZ6ZpanGcLDIsmSesZVisLOxwKaq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
