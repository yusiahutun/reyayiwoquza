And who are we to disagree? From a lavish restaurant empire (which grew in 2019 with Vanderpump Cocktail Garden in Las Vegas) that has earned her a net worth only bested by the Kardashians in entrepreneurial reality talent to her numerous charity endeavours – including Vanderpump Dogs, the pet adoption centre she opened in 2017 – Lisa, 59, may just be the “Queen of Beverly Hills.”</p><p id=eYQAANISmeAq data-wc=32>She's the kind of star that other celebrities go gaga over, too. LVP, as her friends call her, is beloved by some of the biggest names in Hollywood – think <a class=hm-link href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a>.</p><p id=ey40iyjNPNNt data-wc=58>Chart-topper <a class=hm-link href=#>Rihanna</a> has even gushed to Vogue about the business mogul, admitting she is total "goals." Enjoying the fact that she's "chic but still funny, Rihanna said of Lisa: "She likes to be at home with her husband and then goes and handles her business. Maybe there's a couple of thousand Birkins in her closet, but she's still focused."</p><p id=eKb_-yrA16U4 data-wc=30>She's admired, too, by stars such as <a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Gaga</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, who have stopped in at TomTom (Lisa's newest restaurant) to hang out with the TV personality. Talk about a loyal fanbase!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7d452f851d0c-body35-z.jpg><p class=caption id=eyxIolJTm_Fa data-wc=15>Lance Bass is just one of Lisa's many celebrity admirers.

Here she is in her own words...</p><h2>What’s in a name</h2><p id=eQ5cevbC8Ojg data-wc=41>"Vanderpump is a Dutch name – a bit strange-sounding. It’s my maiden name. I got married at 21, and everyone back then changed their last names. But I said, 'I am not giving up Vanderpump!' So I was always Lisa Vanderpump."</p><h2>Ruling the coop</h2><p id=er38_0MQ6xpo data-wc=81>"When we pitched Vanderpump Rules initially… there was definitely an upstairs-downstairs element to the concept. Someone – I think it was one executive at Bravo – said it was going to be too much of a show about Hollywood wannabes, bu everyone who is a waiter in Hollywood is a wannabe. That is why it is interesting. Plus, we had this organic group of friends, an authentic circle, who were so intermingled. It is a comedy, but it is also dramatic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c8a05641e9d-body35-z.jpg><p class=caption id=e7pE1qCIN2TD data-wc=21>Lisa and husband Ken Todd have two children together: Pandora, 33, and adopted son Max, 28. Photo: © Tibrina Hobson/Getty Images</p><h2>Lasting love</h2><p id=eOd5IYEpFAwz data-wc=107>"I met my husband, <strong>Ken</strong> [Todd], in a nightclub and got engaged after six weeks of knowing him. Would I recommend that to young people now? Probably not. It was the strangest thing. He was wrong for me in every sense – 16 years older, playboy, in the nightclubs. But he asked me for my number and that was that. He is older, but he has always met me halfway, has never put me down, always asks my opinions on things. And, of course, things change – I have changed throughout the years and have become more confident – but I have always felt him beside me."</p><h2>Living with loss</h2><p id=enVCbqkd8gCv data-wc=39>"Losing my brother to suicide [last year] was difficult. He was my only sibling. I really floundered with that. And then I lost my mother not long after that. We all have to deal with loss in our life."</p><h2>Real talk</h2><p id=eF0_J0BvKjV1 data-wc=52>"When I was asked to do Housewives, reality TV was quite different. We mainly knew it from shows like The Osbournes. I initially told them no, as I did not think I had enough conflict in my life and wasn't sure if it would be interesting. But little did I know...
