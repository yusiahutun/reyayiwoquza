You change the batteries, bang it on your desk a few times, and curse at the technology godsâ€”but it's all to no avail.</p><p>It doesn't have to be this way. There are steps you can take to get your left click working again on your mouse. Here are some ways to get moving again when your mouse left click is not working properly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=fix-a-corrupted-user-profile>1. Fix a Corrupted User Profile</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows-local-account.jpg><p>You need to establish whether the problem is unique to your user account or a system-wide issue.</p><p>Make a temporary new local account by navigating to <strong>Start > Settings > Accounts > Family and Other Users> Add Someone Else to This PC</strong>. The app will ask you for the new user's sign-in details and name.</p><p>Now, log into the new profile. Is your left-click working again? If so, your primary user account has probably become corrupted.</p><p>Try copying all your user data to a new profile. You need at least three profiles (your new one, your corrupted one, and one extra) on your machine to undertake this process.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Log onto the extra one. All the following steps need to be done from the "spare" account.</p><p>Firstly, open <strong>File Explorer</strong> and ensure both the hidden files and folders and the protected operating system files are viewable. If you cannot see them, go to <strong>View > Options > View</strong> and make the necessary adjustments.</p><p>Next, navigate to <strong>C:\Users\[Corrupted Username]</strong> and select all the files except <strong>Ntuser.dat</strong>, <strong>Ntuser.dat.log</strong>, and <strong>Ntuser.ini</strong>. Copy the files and paste them into <strong>C:\Users\[New Username]</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Finally, log off and sign in to your new account. Once you've verified everything is working, you can delete the spare account and the corrupted account.</p><h2 id=check-for-corrupted-windows-data>2. Check for Corrupted Windows Data</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Corrupted-Windows-Data-670x404.png><p>If you still couldn't use the left mouse button on your new profile, it's indicative that something has gone wrong within Windows itself. One of the most common culprits is a corrupted Windows Update.</p><p>To test for the presence of corrupted Windows files, you need to run PowerShell (by right-click on the Start menu and select it from the list).</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Next, you need to run the System File Checker tool.</p><p>Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. You'll see one of three results:</p><li>Windows did not find any integrity violations.</li><li>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and repaired them.</li><li>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some (or all) of them.</li><p>In the case of the last, type <strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. PowerShell will re-download any corrupted files. It could take a long time, so be patient.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=delete-any-recently-installed-apps-and-drivers>3. Delete Any Recently Installed Apps and Drivers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows-settings-apps.jpg><p>Have you recently installed any new apps and software? It could be the reason that the left click is not working. Similarly, a program update might have caused the issue.</p><p>Go to <strong>Settings > Apps</strong>. Delete any apps that you've recently installed, any apps that have recently received automatic updates, and any apps you no longer use. Restart your machine and see if the problem is solved.</p><p>In a comparable vein, lots of&nbsp;users have pointed to errant drivers causing the problem. The most common culprit appears to be printer drivers.</p><p>Delete your existing drivers by heading to <strong>Start > Settings > Devices > Printers and Scanners</strong>. Click on the printer you want to delete, and hit <strong>Remove</strong>.</p><h2 id=delete-and-reinstall-your-antivirus>4. Delete and Reinstall Your Antivirus</h2><p>Something as straightforward as uninstalling and reinstalling your antivirus suite could solve your issues.</p><p>Occasionally, they detect false positives or black-flag harmless processes. Panda Anti-Virus seems to pop up more often than most. If you're using Panda, this could be your problem.</p><p>Before you completely uninstall and reinstall, you can soft-test whether this is the issue. Disconnect from the internet and temporarily disable any third-party security suites. You can also try <a class=no-callout href=#>booting into Safe Mode</a>&nbsp;to exclude software issues.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=hard-reset-your-computer>5. Hard Reset Your Computer</h2><p>Performing a hard reset is not good practice and should be done sparingly. That said, many users have reported that it fixes a non-functioning left mouse button.</p><p>It is easy to do a hard reset (also known as a hard crash). If you're on a desktop without a battery, pull out the power lead. If you're on a laptop, pull the power cord and the battery. In both cases, you need to be logged into a user account on the PC before executing the reset.</p><h2 id=update-mouse-drivers>6. Update Mouse Drivers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mouse-drivers-windows.jpg><p>It's prudent to make sure your mouse drivers are always up-to-date. If the&nbsp;left click isn't working, you definitely need to check them.</p><p>Right-click on the Start Menu and then choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Don't worry: you can also use the right-click button to make your selection.</p><p>Next, use your keyboard arrows to scroll down to <strong>Mice and other pointing devices</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Select your mouse and press <strong>Enter</strong> again. The <strong>Properties</strong> window will open.</p><p>Use <strong>Tab</strong> and the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to navigate to the <strong>Driver</strong> tab and select <strong>Update Drivers</strong>. Windows will take care of the rest.</p><h2 id=enable-clicklock>7. Enable ClickLock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mouse-settings-windows.jpg><p>What if everything is working except drag-and-drop? If you've already worked through the six fixes and you're still encountering the issue, you can temporarily enable <strong>ClickLock</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>ClickLock lets you drag-and-drop files and folders using single mouse clicks, rather than having to hold down the left mouse button physically.</p><p>To turn it on, go to <strong>Start > Settings > Devices > Mouse > Related Settings > Additional Mouse Options</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Mouse Properties</strong> window will pop up. At the bottom of the <strong>Buttons</strong> tab, you'll see the <strong>ClickLock</strong> options. Put a tick in the checkbox to enable it. Clicking on <strong>Settings</strong> will allow you to customize your ClickLock preferences.</p><h2 id=is-the-left-mouse-button-still-not-working>Is the Left Mouse Button Still Not Working?</h2><p>Did none of these fixes work? You did remember to check the batteries, didn't you?</p><p>Of course, your mouse itself might be faulty. Try using a wired mouse and see if the problem vanishes. And remember, it's always worth thoroughly cleaning your mouse. Dust can quickly build up inside its electronic components.</p><p>If all else fails, remember that you can navigate around your computer using nothing more than the keyboard if you know the right shortcuts. This is good, because the mouse can suffer from a wide range of different problems, and you'll need to know how to navigate Windows 10 with minimal mouse use so you can make the proper fixes.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fm7a5ecuena1lnaTCtLGMm6ytrJ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
