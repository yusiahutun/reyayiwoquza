I AM GRATEFUL I AM THANKFUL I AM BLESSED.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>A bevy of celebrities showed love to Chaka Zulu and wished him well on his road to recovery.</p><p>Ludacris simply left a crown emoji while <a href=# rel=noopener>Killer Mike</a> said love and respect. <a href=# rel=noopener>E-40</a> left praying hands and a crown emoji while <a href=# rel=noopener>T.I.</a> left similar sentiments.</p><p>Check out his post below:</p><p>Last September, Chaka was <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>charged with murder over the fatal shooting of a man outside his Atlanta restaurant</a> but as of January, there haven’t been any updates, except for his attorney Gabe Banks issuing a statement via <a href=# rel=noopener>AllHipHop</a>.</p><p>“The Fulton County District Attorney’s Office is still investigating this matter,” Banks said. “At this time, there are no upcoming court dates. He needs [the love]. More importantly, he appreciates it.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>In September 2022, <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> published surveillance footage from outside Zulu’s APT 4B restaurant in June 2022, which shows <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>the Disturbing Tha Peace co-founder firing the deadly shots</a> into the victim, 23-year-old Artez Benton, as well as the fight that preceded it.</p><p>The almost three-minute long clip captures Chaka Zulu (real name Ahmed Obafemi) getting into a verbal confrontation with another man, Tre’mon Robinson, in the restaurant parking lot. As the pair argue, another man, Corey Crawford, can be seen retrieving something out of a vehicle, which Zulu’s legal team believe was a gun.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>Things turn physical when Robinson appears to chest bump Zulu, who retaliates by shoving Robinson into a nearby car and grabbing him by the collar. Crawford, Benton and another man immediately jump in to help Robinson, with all four pummeling Zulu with punches, kicks and stomps.</p><p>Zulu’s female assistant jumps in to try to defend Zulu, but ends up getting punched in the face by Robinson. After getting back on his feet, Zulu can be seen brandishing a gun and firing at least one shot into Benton, knocking him to the ground.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/06/Chaka-Zulu-250x142.jpeg alt="Ludacris' Manager Chaka Zulu Arrest Warrant Provides More Details In Fatal Triple Shooting" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Ludacris' Manager Chaka Zulu Arrest Warrant Provides More Details In Fatal Triple Shooting</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>September 19, 2022</p></a><p>Crawford, off-camera, then fires multiple shots of his own, with at least one striking Zulu in the back.</p><p>Police arrived at the scene, after which Zulu and Benton were rushed to a local hospital and underwent emergency surgery.
