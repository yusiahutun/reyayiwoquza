Toyhouse invite codes are available to users who have already created an account or are invited by other users with platform accounts.</p><h2>How do invite codes work?</h2><p class=align-left>When creating an account on most websites, you can only submit your email, password, username, phone number, and birthday, if necessary. The information is readily accessible to you.</p><p class=align-left>For Toyhouse, you need an invite code and other personal details. Toyhouse only gives out invite codes when the site feels like it requires new users. The option allows the site to control the number of users joining at anytime.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d523b821c021bd21.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>7 best apps like Coomeet for free and random video chats</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The free Toyhouse invite codes are not accessible to you. You cannot create an account with the site unless you have it. Therefore, the purpose of an invite code on Toyhouse is to facilitate the creation of an account.</p><p class=align-left>You can use the unused Toyhouse codes to make alternate or additional accounts on the platform. For example, you can use the codes to create a community account or any other account to store your characters.</p><h2>How do you get a Toyhouse invite code?</h2><p class=align-left>You can get Toyhouse invite codes using different strategies. Here are some popular methods you can use to access the codes and acquire the original characters:</p><h3>1. Sign up for premium membership</h3><p class=align-left>A premium account offers the fastest way of getting a Toyhouse invite code. It costs <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$4.95 per month</a> to sign up for a premium account. Alternatively, you can pay $24.95 to sign up for an annual account.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84b8d3598e2d2858.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a letter to your friend inviting him to attend your birthday party</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As a premium member, you will get an invite code every Sunday. You can use the code for additional services on the platform or send it to a friend and allow them to join it.</p><h3>2. Check the Toyhouse member forum</h3><p class=align-left>The <a id=https://toyhou.se/~forums href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Toyhouse member forum</a> is the best platform for getting free invite codes. Most members often post codes on the platform, giving many a chance to access them. However, millions of people visit the site daily. Therefore, you must be quick to use the code before it expires.</p><p class=align-left>If you receive a code from the member forum, Toyhouse recommends that you should post on the forum confirming that you have received the code. However, the site forbids you from lying about having taken a public code to reserve it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d523b821c021bd21.png><h3>3. Ask around</h3><p class=align-left>Asking around may be the most challenging part of looking for a Toyhouse code. It requires you to ask for a code in places not affiliated with Toyhouse. For example, you can use <a href=#>social media platforms</a> to ask users whether they can spare you a Toyhouse invite code.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a9e2ef0db204055.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to fix This page isn't available right now on Facebook</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The best places to look around for an invite code include pet or adoptable sites, Deviantart, and Discord. If you know a friend already registered with Toyhouse, you can ask them to send you an invite code once the Toyhouse invite code generator generates new codes every Sunday.</p><p class=align-left>You can suggest how many codes you need to avoid posting multiple invite codes. When asking around for codes, follow the Toyhouse rules for such an activity. In other words, avoid sending unsolicited messages to other users requesting codes.</p><p class=align-left>Toyhouse prohibits sending messages to other users asking or begging for invite codes. However, you can only send a message if a user has specified that you should send them a <a href=#>direct message</a>.</p><h3>4. Trade invite codes</h3><p class=align-left>Toyhouse allows users who have access to invite codes to trade them. Trading involves buying Toyhouse invite codes from other users. While Toyhouse allows the trading of codes, it recommends limiting how much money one can spend on invite codes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/85d8d5fbaea928ee.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What the Page Not Found Instagram error means and how to fix it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Toyhouse recommends not spending more than $1 on codes. Instead, you can get the codes for cents on the dollar. Although you can trade codes, understand that Toyhouse does not have a sanctioned vendorfor codes.</p><p class=align-left>How do you avoid getting scammed when trading codes on Toyhouse? If you choose to buy codes, ensure the person you buy from has a public profile. That will allow you to check on <a href=#>comments</a> to determine whether they have been in recent complaints about scamming others.</p><p class=align-left>Also, avoid sending money via friends and <a href=#>family</a>. Instead, send money as goods and services. The friends and family option does not offer purchase protection. It also prevents you from requesting a refund if the seller does not deliver.</p><p class=align-left>The same applies when using money transfer apps like<a href=#> Cash App</a> or Venmo. These apps do not offer purchase protection. Therefore, Toyhouse does not recommend them for trading invite codes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4c6d89e392482194.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why is the KCB app not working?

Use Tumblr</h3><p class=align-left>Tumblr has a Toyhouse invite code exchange community. The community has grown bigger because they exchange codes almost daily. Also, the community has a Donators list, where new donors are added to help others access codes.</p><h2>Where are Toyhouse codes?</h2><p class=align-left>Toyhouse invite codes are only accessible to users of the platform. If you already have an account with the site, you can find the codes under Invitations. You will get the option under Settings, then head to the bottom of the side navigation.</p><p class=align-left>You can only access the code with a premium account. Also, premium users only get<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> two codes per week</a>. Note that the number of invite codes you get each week will depend on your subscription plan. For example, signing up for premium on a 6-week plan will get 12 codes.</p><p class=align-left>New users who have signed up with premium may not get the codes immediately. Instead, they must wait at least a week for their codes under Invitations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec61c9203fc308ad.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Equity app is not working?
