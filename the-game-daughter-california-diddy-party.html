"After talking to her thoroughly for over an hour about it, I agreed to let my daughter rock ... being that she wears a school uniform 5 days a week."</p><p>"My daughter has grown tremendously over the last year & is now almost 5'9 in height & beautiful. She's a straight A student & is shy in most cases & dresses like a Tom boy in baggy jeans and Dr. Martin boots damn near everyday," he continued. "The twins had a futuristic bday theme & my baby wanted to look great & be in full confidence going to support her friends celebration."</p><p>He then concluded: "I am her father & her protector and she is & will always be an amazing young woman. I wish everyone happy holidays & thanks for your opinions on a child that belongs to US but we GOT THIS. üôèüèæ"</p><p>Both Tiffney and Cali shared additional photos from the event, with the girl's mom sending commenting on one of the photos: "Hey Cals!!
