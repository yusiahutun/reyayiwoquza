The 75-year-old says he won't take the stage with his bandmates in 2024 (and beyond).</p><p>A replacement for Bonsall named Ben James was introduced last week.</p><ul><li>The Oak Ridge Boys <a href=#>announced</a> the American Made: Farewell Tour in September, 2023.</li><li>The 50th anniversary tour came with a note that they'd play far fewer dates each year moving forward.</li><li>"My legs aren't what they used to be," Bonsall told Billboard at the time.</li></ul><h3>What&nbsp;Happened&nbsp;to the Oak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall?</h3><p>Bonsall's decision to retire from the road seems sudden, but it looks to have been inevitable.&nbsp;The slow onset of a neuromuscular disorder has made walking impossible, he tells <a href=#>People</a>,&nbsp;"So I have basically retired from the road."</p><p>Collectively, the group has pressed on, despite several medical emergencies and issues over the last half-decade. Bonsall had a <a href=#>brush with death</a> in 2022 when doctors found pulmonary embolisms.</p><p>"I could have easily died last weekend," he tweeted that June, "but God is not through with me yet."</p><p>Prior to that, Bonsall admitted to having a genetic condition called&nbsp;Dupuytrenâ€™s disease, which John Hopkins defines as a gradual thickening and tightening of tissue under the skin in the hand. He had surgery in 2017 to help him use his hand properly again.</p><p>"I will never forget," he said of his 50 years with the band. "And for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying."</p><h3>Who Will Replace Joe Bonsall?</h3><p>People notes that a 27-year-old named Ben James will replace Bonsall. He was introduced to the band during a 2022 show in West Virginia and had the opportunity to sing Bonsall's part. James is a lifelong fan who says "Elvira" was on repeat in his home growing up.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>John Michael Montgomery Reveals Retirement Plans</a></p><p>This year marks 51 years since the Oak Ridge Boys began performing with a lineup of Bonsall, Duane Allen, William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban. The Country Music Hall of Famers have 17 No. 1 hits, including&nbsp;seventeen No. 1 hits, including "Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight, "Trying&nbsp;to Love Two Women" and "Elvira."</p><p>At the time of the American Made: Farewell Tour announcement, they'd only shared dates through 2023 but a check of the band's <a href=#>official website</a> shows about 20 concerts on the calendar in 2024. They indicated they'd play 50 to 60 each year moving forward, about half of what they played previously.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Oak Ridge Boys Legend William Lee Golden's Stunning Historic Plantation Home</h2><p>Legendary Oak Ridge Boys singer William Lee Golden lives in a very historic property outside of Nashville, and pictures show a stunning manor home that's been updated without losing its original appeal.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmqJmbYr%2BqsMaeZJunqah6q7vEZpmopqOWua150Z6roqqVorKvwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
