Despite <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> pointing out they had a cat when they were children, Jason didn’t seem too keen on getting one. He did say, however, there could be a possible compromise. <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is well known for her love of cats. She loves them so much, some could say she mentioned her love for her furry friends <a href=#>in some of her biggest hits</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kylie-kelce-getting-a-cat-could-help-her-bond-with-taylor-swift>Kylie Kelce getting a cat could help her bond with Taylor Swift</h2><p>During the recent episode posted yesterday (January 31) Jason and Travis were discussing listeners’ comments and Jason’s wife had left one which they featured. The older sibling’s quote from the previous episode went viral when he said he didn’t ask permission to rip off his shirt and wildly celebrate Trav’s touchdown. The moment made headlines, and even Taylor was enjoying it.</p><p>But Jason’s wife Kylie had the perfect response.</p><p>Kylie penned: “‘I’m not asking for permission, I’m doing this.’ – the exact quote I will say when I’m grabbing the keys to go get a cat.”</p><p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Donna Kelce gives Taylor Swift her stamp of approval with a sweet Travis-themed ring</a></p><p>Jason Kelce was not best pleased about Kylie possibly buying a cat, even if it meant she bonded with Taylor Swift. He even went as far as to say he Google’d “how to lose” a cat, to no avail.</p><p>“Only outdoor cats,” Jason said, when NFL-playing Travis teased back: “We know how much of a cat fan you are.”</p><p>“Listen,’ Jason, 36, said: “I respect what a cat can do in nature. It’s a ferocious, hunting animal.”</p><p>Travis replied he believes his older brother “only respects it” as they had cats growing up. “That’s what Flash was [an outdoor cat],” Jason replied defensively. “I once saw Flash kill a bird mid-flight.”</p><p>Jason continued: “I don’t want one wandering like this ragdoll… I’ve learned so much about cats over the last week. People sending ‘Oh you guys should get a ragdoll, you should get this, you should get a tabby.’ I didn’t even know there were cat breeds! I didn’t know that was a whole thing!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-but-jason-really-doesn-t-want-a-cat>But, Jason really doesn’t want a cat</h2><p>The 36-year-old added: “I Googled how to lose a cat, but nothing came up. The only thing that came up was like, ‘Oh are you sad you just lost your cat?’ I’m like ‘No I need to lose a cat!’ Like I’m not worried about losing it, I wanna lose it!”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> said he was “surprised” there was nowhere to “accidentally” lose the pet. “If a cat does show up, it will find its way off our property in some way,” he teased.</p><p>“Unless it’s an outdoor cat,” protested Travis, 34. “You said you will appreciate an outdoor cat.” He also pointed out they currently own two Irish Hounds, who are free to go and come as they please.</p><p>“I do,” replied Jason. “but knowing Kylie, it’s gonna find its way indoors … It’s not gonna happen. Kids are gonna want it up in their bedroom, there’s gonna be cat stuff all over the place. No.”</p><p>Even if they don’t end up getting a new furry friend, Taylor definitely has enough cats to share so perhaps Kylie could cat-sit when the 34-year-old begins the next leg of her Eras Tour.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Travis Kelce is the ‘same guy in the locker room’ after dating Taylor Swift</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2V%2BcLbArKanZZuauaSxjJ2mnqueqXq4rc2tZLChlpp6rMXLopxmrJ9itKbAjJpknJmkYq%2B2wIyiq51lo5i8s7GMqaaipqSoeri106FkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
