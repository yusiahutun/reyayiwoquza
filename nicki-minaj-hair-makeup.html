Not only did she serve one of the most amazing beauty looks of the night, she also&nbsp;opened the show with a truly incredible performance, called&nbsp;Miley out live on stage AND&nbsp;won the award for Best Hip-Hop&nbsp;Video. Not bad for a night’s work.</p><p>But Nicki is so much more than a professional thrower of shade: her music is incredible,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>she’s been the highest paid woman in hip-hop for four years running</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;speaks out passionately about <a href=# rel=nofollow>feminist issues</a>. Plus, we love a woman who can work a pink wig the way that she can. For all these reasons and more, Nicki Minaj is our Woman Crush Wednesday.

Note the light eyeshadow and dark liner, bubblegum-pink lips worn with black and pink hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-pink-hair-2010.jpg><p>Following the release of Pink Friday, Nicki was a bonafide star—and her alter-ego had a colorful signature look to go along with it. The neon blue eyeshadow, long fake lashes and hot pink, hand-painted wig helped establish her&nbsp;Harajuku Barbie character and differentiate her from the ‘real’ Nicki Minaj.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-green-hair-2010.jpg><p>Nicki has always cited fashion legend Betsey Johnson as one of her all-time biggest influences, and you can even see that in her beauty choices here.&nbsp;Teal hair, glitter eyeliner, grass-green shadow and baby-pink lips certainly constitutes A Lot Of Look, name one person who could pull this off half as well as Minaj&nbsp;does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-american-music-awards-2011.jpg><p>By the time she swept the 2011 American Music Awards, Nicki was beginning to turn down the volume on her signature look. Her hair is still pink, but the retro curls give it a more sophisticated vibe. The false lashes are still long and thick, but the brows are more full and natural-looking. And without the heavy contouring, the candy pink lips provide the perfect focal point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-vmas-2012.jpg><p>By 2012, Nicki’s look was still larger than life—but it was being executed in a more sophisticated way. Observe the subtle contacts, seriously perfected (but still dewy-looking) skin, beyond perfectly blended blush and glam glitter eyeshadow. And honestly, if one is going to wear a neon wig, the MTV VMAs are basically the perfect occasion for it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-met-gala-2013.jpg><p>And just like that, in 2013, Nicki’s look took a turn for the undeniably chic. At the Met Gala Ball, she paired wine-red lips with a double-tailed cat eye, higher arched (yet softer colored) brows and some seriously voluminous hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-blonde.jpg><p>During Fashion Week of 2014, Nicki’s beauty style streamlined further: softly curled blonde hair and nude lips provided the perfect foil for dramatic smokey eyes and her preferred long, dark eyelashes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-cat-eye.jpg><p>The 2014 MTV Movie Awards heralded an almost minimalist Minaj. She had just completed recording The Pinkprint, her most personal album yet, and was showing a more “real” side of herself that was less reliant on caricatures and alter-egos. With sideswept black and brown hair, nude lipgloss and an angular (yet understated) cat eye, this was one of her most iconic red carpet looks yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-grammys-2015.jpg><p>Nicki was nominated for a Grammy in 2015, and even thought she didn’t win, her look was totally&nbsp;killer. Peach-pink lips, smokey eyes (with a focus on the top eyelid only; she left her bottom lashline totally bare) and slightly darker eyebrows. Add in a 90s-inspired side flip, and you have a look that’s elegant rock n roll perfection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/09/nicki-minaj-vmas-2015.jpg><p>And at <a href=#>the 2015 VMAs</a>, Nicki debuted her most amazing beauty look yet: a dramatic cat eye paired with her signature major eyelashes, pinky-nude lips, softly contoured cheeks and a whole lot of highlight. We especially love how she’s brought the dark bangs back; it’s a gorgeous&nbsp;callback to her 2010 look. And her performance?&nbsp;She shut it down; no other performer on the planet can touch her. We love you, Nicki!</p><p><strong>More from Daily Makeover: <a href=#>25 Years of Jennifer Aniston’s Hair</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2htZmp9coCOp6Cco5liuqq6wKNkoZmZp3qurcqerKln</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
