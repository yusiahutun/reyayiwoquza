As the final two episodes had to be filmed virtually, each of the queens had their final performances in their own homes.</p><p>But it wasn’t the change in format that got viewers talking. Throughout the ‘At Home’ episodes, RuPaul Charles decided to don a face mask which set the internet ablaze with questions.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>So, why was RuPaul wearing a face mask for the Drag Race final episodes?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-80740 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-01-at-13.13.24.png alt width=1221 height=673 sizes="(max-width: 1221px) 100vw, 1221px">Screenshot: RuPaul’s Drag Race S12 E14 – Netflix<h3>RuPaul Charles’s blue mask on Drag Race</h3><p>In episode 13, RuPaul started to wear a blue mask for filming.

The main theory circulating was that RuPaul actually cannot do her own hair and makeup, as we could see Ru had no glam on underneath the mask.</p><p>Another theory which one fan put out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>on Twitter</span></a> was that RuPaul had a facelift and was using the mask to cover up the post-surgical bruises. We don’t think there’s legs to this theory though, as managing to get a facelift in quarantine would be a pretty impressive feat!</p><p>The third theory went along the lines that Ru just decided to not dress up in her usual drag. One Twitter user said: “She never does drag for the reunions. It’s meant to look like a face mask and pyjamas based on the slumber party theme.”</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WE WANT MORE:</strong></a></span> Will Drag Race All Stars 5 be on Netflix?</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She never does drag for the reunions.
