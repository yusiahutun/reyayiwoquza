I loved working on Ally McBeal, and it just made it sour. I was very sleep-deprived and I was depressed about it. I did think that it was going to ruin my career. I didn’t think anybody would ever hire me again, because they would just assume I had anorexia, and that would be the end of that.”</p><p>"I had days where I was really hurt and embarrassed and infuriated," she added. "I was lucky that I had to work. I just put my head down. I always felt like, 'Calista, you’re a good person, you’re not mean to anybody,' and I'm confident in that."</p><p>Flockhart also pointed out that she doesn't believe people would make assumptions about her weight if she starred in Ally McBeal today.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:10b01c37-1e8a-47a3-80a8-6fa38a94a0e1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:199e55ec-a7bd-4f86-9081-f8ab7a32a74f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5f/5by4/2023/02/08/5f5f0b074b384a308b66914cd7896296_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Harrison Ford's Wife Calista Flockhart Won't Fly In Vintage Planes With Him Following 2015 Crash</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I don't think that would ever happen today," she said. "They call it body-shaming now. I haven’t thought about it in a long time, but it’s really not OK to accuse someone of having a disease that a lot of people struggle with."</p><p>"It wasn't the case, and there was nothing I could do to convince anybody or get out of it," she added. "If I had worn a big padded bra, they probably would never have been able to target me in that way. I look back at pictures, and I'm the same then as I am now, and nobody says a word now."</p><p>Flockhart shared that she's "never been in a situation" where she had to "watch my weight," noting that her mother weighed less than a 100 pounds when she was married, and is now 4'11.</p><p>"I just have small bones," added the star, who is 5'5, "and I just am lucky.”</p><a id=gallery-link-1c7d6e66-7d70-4949-a595-62fb565074eb class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:1c7d6e66-7d70-4949-a595-62fb565074eb data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:199e55ec-a7bd-4f86-9081-f8ab7a32a74f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7a/4by3/2024/01/15/7a447a7f55f14f3495d7e618f4227df3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma29fmK6ttdKtmGaenKSwrLTAq6tmrJikwqi002aYp6eimsWqrYyrrKanoqh6uLvUpZtmqqWeu26vwKucnqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
