He doesn’t really want to come until his father and his brother promise to apologize to Meghan,” she told host, Mark Dolan.</p><p>However, the royal biographer says Meghan should apologize to <a href=#>King Charles</a> herself. “Actually, one would imagine Meghan should apologize to them, but that’s it. And they’ve come to a sort of end, really, somehow.”</p><p>She then claims the King “will say the door is open, come when you want to,” but says Harry doesn’t want to until he gets an apology.</p><p>Harry has a love for the military, and told Levin previously that was “where he felt most himself.”</p><p>The remembrance service, which was missed by the Duke on Sunday, the family paid their respects to those who gave their lives in the line of duty, and to mark the end of the First World War.</p><p>Levin claims Harry, who was miles away in his <a href=#>$15 million LA mansion</a>, wanted to do his very best for his country. And that’s all gone out the window, I’m afraid,” she said.</p><p>Reacting to Levin’s claims, Dolan said what a lot of the UK is thinking, that the circumstances around the Duke and his family are “sad.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-rang-his-father-on-his-birthday>Prince Harry ‘rang his father’ on his birthday</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-918133644-1024x683.jpg><p>As well as the Remembrance event, Harry also missed his father’s 75th birthday celebrations.</p><p>Although there were claims that Harry and Meghan <a href=#>‘snubbed’ the King’s invitation</a>, their spokesperson put out a statement denying this claims.</p><p>“There has been no contact regarding an invitation to His Majesty’s upcoming birthday. It is disappointing the Sunday Times has misreported this story,” they said.</p><p>However, it’s been reported that Charles’ youngest son did have contact with him on his birthday, over the telephone.</p><p>Harry did not however post a public birthday message to him, unlike William and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>, who did over <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>On the platform, they posted some some throwback pics with the King, alongside the caption: “Wishing His Majesty The King a very happy 75th birthday!”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aDcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2KxkrJmUYr%2Bmrcuiq7JlkZvBpr6MsKClpJmWum6tzZ1knKCRp7mmv4ytpqijXZiyr8DEq2SsrJGcsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
