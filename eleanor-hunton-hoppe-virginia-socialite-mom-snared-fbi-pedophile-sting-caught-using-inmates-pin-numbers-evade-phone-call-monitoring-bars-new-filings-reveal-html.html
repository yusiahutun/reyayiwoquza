while she awaits trial</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She filed a motion to the US District Court for the District of Columbia to be freed on <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>December 9 last year saying she was 'not particularly dangerous'</a> and wants to be allowed to live with an aunt while proceedings continue.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was the second time she has attempted to be sprung from incarceration over the case in which she's accused of driving to meet a man she met over the internet – and who she believed would bring his young daughter to a hotel so they could abuse her together.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, the opposition filing states: 'The government has recently discovered that the defendant is engaged in ongoing misconduct at the

to evade monitoring by law enforcement.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It also says that Hoppe claimed to the Department of Corrections that her 76-year-old father and her brother Eppa Hunton VI, 43, are her attorneys of record and so should be on the 'do not record/monitor' list – but the two lawyers are not her legal representatives.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Additionally, it was revealed in the transcripts that members of Hoppe's family are in discussions to have a book written on her case.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a call to her mother Mary, 74, on June 29, 2023, Hoppe said: 'Here's what I'm going to do, because I'm super sick of every time I give you guys sensitive information, it seems to blow up in my face.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I don't know why it took me so
