And instructors will be able to explain how a free Diagnostic Test( DT), and close observation of individual needs ensure that children start at the right level and benefit from tailor-made study plans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We believe in the potential of each child,” says Brenda Wong, deputy general manager of Kumon Hong Kong. “We strive to help them cultivate self-learning abilities and problem-solving skills. In the free trial lessons, we are aiming to show parents how our methods and systematically designed worksheets build up good learning habits and develop the innate talents of each student.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Along the way, instructors provide any necessary guidance with the worksheets. But in teaching maths and languages, they also encourage the development of skills like logical thinking, listening, speaking, reading, writing and comprehension. As a result, each student’s ability in all these areas is progressively enhanced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Behind this lies a general philosophy: if you give a child a fish, you feed him for a day; if you teach a child to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We strongly believe that this principle applies to study as well,”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brenda says. “Instead of providing knowledge to children directly, we nurture an attitude that initiates self-learning and equips them with skills which help them persist in the long run. Our classes are structured to support this principle, and all the children become proactive and enthusiastic learners.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For example, a typical English (EFL or ERP) class might include colourful textbooks, fun stories and songs, all carefully chosen to get students interested and involved. At the more advanced levels, there would be greater emphasis on sentence structures, correct grammar, useful phrases, and practical vocabulary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Similarly, the Mandarin course might start out with some nursery rhymes to help in mastering the basics. But the older students would be looking at classic Chinese poems and wide selection of texts and literature to improve their reading comprehension, writing skills, and all-round fluency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In turn, the programme in maths deliberately uses worksheets which can be adapted to any academic curriculum around the world. The instructors use various exercises to enhance the speed of mental arithmetic. And they teach a logical, analytical approach to solving a range of problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our instructors observe, intervene or help at the appropriate time, and set progress objectives based on individual abilities,” Brenda says. “They assign homework after evaluating the performance of each student in that day’s classwork.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Class size varies depending on capacity available at the different centres. And while children of different ages and nationalities may study in a centre at the same time, they will have the appropriate worksheets and personalised study plans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Generally, students attend once a week, with classwork planned and arranged to develop necessary skills and knowledge. Special attention is given to encouraging the right habits and attitudes, correcting mistakes, completing assignments, and making use of supplementary tools like magnetic number boards and CDs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Naturally, all subjects meet the needs of Hong Kong’s core curriculum. However, parents can also fine-tune things to match the specific requirements of a school they want their child to attend. In this respect, each Kumon Education Centre can provide professional advice and consultation services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since 1988, more than 5,200 students have successfully completed one or more of the programmes available in Hong Kong and continue to experience the lasting benefits. Around the world, more than four million students in roughly 50 countries &nbsp;and regions can attest to the effectiveness and reliability of the methods.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If parents are impressed with the trial lessons, they can simply contact a Kumon Education Centre about enrolment and fix the day for classes to begin,” Brenda says. “All children have their own strengths and abilities. But in a fast-paced competitive environment, those can be enhanced through a tailor-made programme which cultivates self-learning skills, independent thinking and perseverance.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbOx0p6lrZ2UZLumw9Joq6iomZjAcK3CrWSnp6disrm8xKugnqaTmnqswcyopWallam1sLCOmqmtoZOhsnB%2Bj3BpbmppZLmmrdGnoKefXZ28uHnSraydsV2gwq67zQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
