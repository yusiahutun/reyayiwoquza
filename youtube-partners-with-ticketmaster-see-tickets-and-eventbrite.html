As online viewership and engagement continues to grow, we want to help artists keep fans updated on their upcoming shows and sell more tickets to their live shows. We hope this new feature helps connect fans with not only the global artists they love, but also will give them a chance to discover more intimate events with breakthrough local talent.”</p><p>Peter Quinlan, SVP, commercial for Ticketmaster International, added: “Discovery has always been a watchword for us at Ticketmaster. Whether that’s helping fans to find new, emerging acts or uncover the shows of their most loved artists – allowing fans to discover tickets through an artist’s official channel does just that. It’s already proven to be successful in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, so it’s great to be launching in the UK and Ireland.”</p><p>Paul Everett, head of music at Eventbrite UK and Ireland, said: “YouTube is a fantastic addition to our growing list of global distribution partners. This latest partnership represents an incredible opportunity for our independent organisers across the UK and Ireland, enabling them to integrate their events on our platform with their Youtube artist profiles, and to surface tickets directly to the massive audience engaging with music there.”</p><p>Rob Wilmshurst, Global CEO at See Tickets, added: “See Tickets are delighted to be partnering with YouTube. This new feature enables fans not only to discover events for their favourite artists, but then to buy them securely on our website. We’re already proud to be working with a fantastic array of partners and affiliates around Europe and North America, so adding someone as powerful as YouTube to that network is something we’re really pleased about.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfZBoaXBnqaTCtcHBnmSpmaKpu6a%2B0mauoqyYYsGqr8qeq6aZo6mys3nSnpxmrJmYuKbA0maYp5xdmsOmutObqaKslWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
