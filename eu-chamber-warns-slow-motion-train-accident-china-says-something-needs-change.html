that strategically viable industries constituting the European industrial base are being priced out of the market,” he said. “That is where trade becomes a security question.”</p><h3 type=h3

European Union increased after Brussels launched an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text

introduced a de-risking strategy to cut reliance on Chinese imports.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, China relies on advanced manufacturing and exports to prop up its economic growth, while pushing for indigenous technology and home-grown champions, which have raised concerns among foreign companies.</p>Increased industrial investments, coupled with a lack of domestic demand amid low consumption in China, have led to criticism in the EU and the United States about the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">overcapacity of Chinese manufactured goods</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The chamber said in a report on navigating security risks in China, published on Wednesday, that overcapacity has distorted competition in the EU.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">There needs to be perhaps a little bit more focus on the demand side in ChinaJens Eskelund</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brussels has also complained about its substantial trade deficit with China and Beijing’s slow progress in opening market access.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The EU trade deficit with China hit a decade record €397 billion (US$423 billion) in 2022 before falling to €291 billion last year, according to the bloc’s data.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is hard for me to imagine that Europe will sit by quietly and witness the accelerated deindustrialisation of Europe because of the externalisation of low domestic demand in China,” Eskelund said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In terms of alleviating some of this pressure, there needs to be perhaps a little bit more focus on the demand side in China to create that demand that will make China less of a perceived threat.”</p>Economic activities in China, including consumption and industrial output, rebounded better than expected <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">in the first two months of the year,</span></a> but concerns persist whether the recovery is only short-lived as the property market remains in doldrums.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report said the EU’s de-risking strategy, which was unveiled last March, is not aimed specifically at China, though it does have “a strong China component” due to a lack of reciprocity in market access and public procurement, state-backed investments into critical infrastructure and technologies in the EU that could potentially impact security.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Foreign businesses in China are more likely to be exposed to regulatory dilemmas caused by geopolitical tensions, the report added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The build-up of China’s comprehensive legal toolbox to retaliate against what it perceives to be foreign interference and long-arm jurisdiction allows the Chinese government to sanction specific foreign companies or individuals, and by doing so disrupt their China operations by, for instance, restricting their investment or market access to China,” it said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Much more honest conversations are needed between China and Europe, as solutions are required to address “the unfolding of a slow-motion train accident”, Eskelund added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, China has taken steps to mitigate risks associated with an over-dependence on foreign supply chains amid Beijing’s focus on self-reliance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report said that during China’s self-reliance push, some imports have been replaced by Chinese or China-based suppliers following provincial or municipal incentives or “pressure”, which have put European firms at “distinct disadvantages”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In some sectors deemed integral to China’s national security, policymakers have gone a step further, issuing explicit directives to replace foreign components and technologies with domestic ones,” the report said, listing procurement rules in IT hardware and medical devices.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a

increasingly complex geopolitical environment Chinese policymakers see operating in, the chamber suspects that China is likely to expand its toolkit to address a growing number of matters regarding national security.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But to create a more sustainable environment for foreign businesses, the chamber said China should steer away from excessive self-reliance and mitigate economic risks in a surgical and precise manner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China should “refrain from erratic policy shifts or punishing companies for the actions of their home governments”, while “develop nuanced strategies for strengthening supply chains that do not err towards trade protectionism”, the chamber said in the report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It also called on China to “engage in dialogue with other governments and key stakeholders to depoliticise the business environment”.</p><p class=postsid
