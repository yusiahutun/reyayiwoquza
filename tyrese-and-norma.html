From the moment they met, Tyrese showered her with expensive gifts, getaways and unlimited access to his credit cards. She claims he asked her to move to the States with him a year later and she dropped out of college and left her family behind to be with him.<br>In 2007, he asked her to marry him after their daughter, Shayla Somer, was born on July 11th, 2007 and required her to sign a prenuptial agreement. She agreed because if she hadn’t, she would have been forced to return home to London with her baby. They got married just three days after she signed the prenup and shortly afterward, they began to have disagreements. Tyrese would become angry and aggressive and leave her home with the baby for days and weeks at a time while he went on vacation, hung out with Brandy, and who knows what else. According to Norma, she didn’t even see the divorce coming because the two had been searching for a home together. She is unable to support herself because she doesn’t have a visa, she has no support system and she always believed he would take care of her and the family.<br>However, Tyrese was paying<br>her $5,000 a month, plus rent on a $2700 apartment and almost $800 a month for the lease on her Range Rover. However, this was not enough for Norma who claims her expenses far exceed the $5000 a month he gives her. a judge ordered Tyrese to fork over $65,000 of his $800,000 income to Norma and the judge upped his child support temporarily.<br>In addition to the settlement of sorts, Norma Gibson will receive $6,230 a month in support, in addition to having her rent and car note paid by the singer/actor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZoq7Kqlaiybq3NnWSnp6Kirg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
