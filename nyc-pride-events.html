My point? The brand’s Mo-jito Mo Problems, Gov Ball Punch, and Mango Fuego cocktails convinced me to add rum to my drinking rotation.</p><p>More exciting Pride 2023 options are hosted by Bacardí this year. Since Monday, June 19, the brand has partnered with iconic LGBTQ+ bars like Boxers, Pieces, Playhouse, and Monster Bar to host happy hours, kickoff parties, and Bacardí samplings. On Friday, June 23 and Saturday, June 24, head to the Pride rooftop party at Boxers Hell’s Kitchen.
