La Rosiere offer private lessons from age 2 and ski school from age 3. I think that's a bit younger than your average resort and so it was perfect for us.</p><p id=ewzbHCVbBVO data-wc=47>"I got all the kids ski gear off Vinted," she continued. "Don't think I spent more than £30 on each child for full ski gear - jackets, salopettes, goggles, gloves, socks etc. Will sell most of it back on Vinted when they grow out of it too.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eJNNMDT7wPq data-wc=28>"It's definitely not easy though.
