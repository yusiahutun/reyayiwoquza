And they didn’t want it for me but they—sorry—they never stopped loving me.”</p><p>Taylor has never also never shied away from expressing her love for the Single Soon singer. Selena also praised Tay with: “The things that she’s overcome, the situations she’s risen above, it’s been a long time since we were friends and she’s the best. She’s just the best.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1661255755-693x1024.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-and-sophie-turner>Taylor Swift and Sophie Turner</h3><p>Taylor and <a href=#>Sophie Turner</a> have been friends for a while and, despite sharing an ex, have grown quite close.
