One of her most magnificent properties to date is her former Malibu farmhouse, where the <a href=#>Big Little Lies</a> star resided with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Jim Toth</strong></a>, and her kids.</p><p>Reese and the talent agent purchased the rustic property, called Zuma Farms, in June 2019, <a href=#>Variety</a> reported. The Little Fires Everywhere actress paid $6.25 million for the California residence, which sat on two acres and boasted endless amounts of space.</p><p>More than a year after settling into the home, however, Reese and Jim sold the estate in November 2020. According to the <a href=#>Dirt</a>, the couple unloaded the house in an off-market deal for just over $6.7 million, making a profit of nearly $500,000.</p><p>As the outlet reported, a woman named <strong>Meg Haney</strong>, the divorced heiress and daughter of Chattanooga real estate billionaire <strong>Franklin Haney</strong>, purchased the extraordinary pad. Fitted with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a spacious kitchen, living rooms and more, there’s no doubt it wasn’t easy for the <a href=#>Legally Blonde</a> alum to say goodbye.</p><p>The <a href=#>Academy Award</a> winner’s Malibu property included more than just their main house. The plot also boasted a guest home, a horse stable and multiple outbuildings. At the time they were still living there, Reese often shared pics of her famous family lounging in their backyard or hanging with their animals.</p><p>On top of all that, Reese and Jim’s abode was fitted with other amenities. It had an art and yoga studio, a private screening room with a bar area and a patio with outdoor entertainment. In the backyard, they were surrounded by dozens of ancient sycamore trees and a vegetable garden.</p><p>The Morning Show actress, who shares her older kids, <a href=#>Ava</a> and <a href=#>Deacon</a>, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Ryan Phillippe</strong></a>, and son <a href=#>Tennessee</a> with Jim, is always traveling the world for her Hollywood career, so nothing makes Reese happier than when she’s home with her children.</p><p>The <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> recipient is especially grateful for R&R with her family at times when she’s <a href=#>struggling to juggle her career and life as a mom</a>. Fortunately, Reese — who owns homes in Los Angeles, Nashville and the Bahamas, per Variety — gets some support from her children.</p><p>“I’m just trying to hold on, trying to make it through. My older kids help with the little one,” she told <a href=#>InStyle</a> in November 2016. “It’s nice to have a big family. My mom worked, and I think it’s good for kids to see women working and being successful.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see photos inside Reese’s former Malibu farmhouse!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZqmenaOaeri106Gcq6ugpLyvecuirZ5loJ28tbvSZqafZZ2Wuaqu1Gadmqqdnby2v8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
