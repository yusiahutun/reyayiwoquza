The man, however, didn't pull over and instead "fled from the officer," said the department.</p><p>When his bike "experienced mechanical issues," he then abandoned it and took off on foot -- with officers on his trail. "The subject fled through Veteran's Memorial Park and ran into the Kalamazoo River to avoid being arrested," said authorities, adding that while attempting to cross the river, the suspect was pushed downstream.</p><p>"Officers observed him go under water and did not resurface. Several officers entered the river in an attempt to rescue the individual; however, he was not found," they added in a statement.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Facebook Video.</p><p>Bodycam footage shared with the public shows the initial pursuit, as the suspect jumps into the river and starts swimming. At points, he appears to be walking through the water, as cops shout, "You're gonna go to jail anyway, dude, give up!"</p><p>"He's trying to go down the river, he's probably going to get hypothermic soon," the officer is heard telling dispatch, as the man continues to swim downstream. "I think he's having trouble swimming, he's going under water. He looks like he's drowning."</p><p>"You're gonna die in there, dude, come on!" the officer shouts, as they warn him he could drown and tell him to use the current to move toward the shore. "He's under water, we have to jump in and get him," says the officer, before they jump into the water to try and get him. At that point, however, the officers lost sight of the suspect.</p><p>Rescue efforts utilizing boats, an aviation unit and dive team were all put into action that same day and continued throughout the week, but by Wednesday -- according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WWMT</strong></a> -- they still haven't located the suspect, whose identity hasn't yet been released.</p><p>Authorities are asking anyone with information to call the Criminal Investigation Division at 269-337-8139 -- or the Kalamazoo Silent Observer tip line at 269-343-2100.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b52e9152-35fd-470d-8f53-49fbf9a2d51e data-container-ref=toofab:article:bde7892b-14a1-4e9a-989e-e1bac98bdfa3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/5by4/2023/11/21/0fe0c2af9a934e12b31458ca9399944f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Headless, Armless Torso Found On Queens Beach Possibly Belongs to Missing Irish Filmmaker</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaWxfpbyttcKeZKysmaG5br%2FEmqmcoJmjtG6yzqtkppmeYsC4sc%2BtZJqvka56qrqMq6CvnaJisba%2ByKeeZpuYlsCmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
