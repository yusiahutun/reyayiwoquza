See the Former Hosts S</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Now that <strong><a href=#>Kathie Lee Gifford</a></strong> has officially left <a href=#>Today</a>, many fans are wondering just how much money the 66-year-old TV personality is leaving behind with her NBC salary. Well, lucky for you, we’ve got the answer!</p><p>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kathie Lee made around $5 million per year when she was a <a href=#>cohost on Today‘s fourth hour</a> with <strong><a href=#>Hoda Kotb</a></strong>. Not bad, right?! Considering she was on the show for 11 years, our girl pocketed millions of dollars just from working at NBC alone.</p><p>In addition to her Today salary, Kathie Lee’s net worth is even more amazing. She is valued at $60 million and that’s all from her decades of work in showbiz. Long before joining the NBC team, the mom of two, of course, hosted <i><a href=#>Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee</a>, </i>authored several books, and has worked as a singer, songwriter and actress.</p><p>So how does Kathie Lee’s net worth compare to <a href=#>the bank accounts of other Today stars</a>? Anchor <strong><a href=#>Savannah Guthrie</a> </strong>has a $8 million yearly salary from NBC but has an overall net worth of around $20 million. Hoda, 55, also makes the same salary as Savannah and has a net worth of $30 million. Their cohost <a href=#><strong>Al Roker</strong></a> is worth $60 million, <strong><a href=#>Carson Daly</a></strong> has $40 million in the bank, <a href=#><strong>Natalie Morales</strong></a>‘ net worth is $16 million and <strong><a href=#>Jenna Bush Hager</a></strong> is worth $10 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/kathie-lee-gifford-hoda-kotb-1.jpg><p>Before <a href=#><strong>Megyn Kelly</strong></a> <a href=#>left NBC</a> in 2018 after <a href=#>questioning why blackface Halloween costumes are “racist,”</a> the former Fox News host was making a $23 million yearly salary with Today and had a $69 million contract with the network. Disgraced TV star <strong><a href=#>Matt Lauer</a> </strong>— who was <a href=#>fired from Today following sexual misconduct allegations</a> in November 2017 — was reportedly being paid $20 million per year.</p><p class=p1>Ultimately, if there’s anything that we can learn from the data, it’s that it pays to be a NBC star! After Kathie Lee left Today, she’s been <a href=#>focusing more on her love life</a> and <a href=#>doing more projects</a> outside of NBC. The blonde beauty may have left her salary behind, but she’s <a href=#>the happiest she’s ever been</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46kmK2gmZp6rbHEZp6inpakv6V50pqjmqqpYsSprdNmm6KcXam1pnnTqJuasV2Wuba5jKaYpJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
