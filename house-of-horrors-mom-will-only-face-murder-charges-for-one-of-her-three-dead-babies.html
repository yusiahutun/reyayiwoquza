Another was found in maggot-infested sweatpants.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:195b9be9-e94a-5917-ac09-1ca1c060d0ad data-container-ref=toofab:article:9ea11ec0-7d5a-5c7c-98dd-b3bc7958a0c5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/81/5by4/2019/05/16/816ae0fc1635577a880073aca4f4ec63_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Murdered Teen Mother Found in Trash Can After Unborn Child Ripped from Her Womb, Lured By Free Baby Clothes</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Four living children, then aged 13, ten, three and six-months, were also removed from the home, some with what appeared to be maggots crawling in their ears.</p><p>The vermin-infested house, which was piled high with trash, junk, soiled diapers and filthy clothes, was subsequently torn down.</p><p>Murray's attorney Keith Halpert had pushed for all murder charges to be dropped, arguing their was no proof she had caused any of the fatalities.</p><p>"What we're left with is a situation where the commonwealth's case is built on odds," he said. "It's built on the notion that really what are the chances she had three pregnancies in a row that resulted in dead babies, unless she did it. That's not evidence. It's rampant speculation, that's all it is."</p><p>But Worcester County Assistant District Attorney Christopher Hodgens argued there was evidence the children were alive, pointing out they had been dressed, and that Murray herself had admitted at least one was born living.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3cfaefdc-cc61-5ce1-bca2-8df3e7e21b80 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9ea11ec0-7d5a-5c7c-98dd-b3bc7958a0c5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fc/5by4/2019/04/17/fcae2211d8db5ba0913fffb546e68e2a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lisa Rinna's Mom Was the Infamous Trailside Killer's First Victim</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"There is ample evidence to find Erika Murray caused the death of her children, with malice," he said. "She intentionally neglected them by secreting their births, secreted them in the home, she never took them outside, deprived them of human contact, never took them to a doctor."</p><p>Murray had earlier claimed she panicked when she gave birth to one of the stillborn child. Aside from the oldest two, none of the children had birth records; Murray gave birth at home in the bathtub, cutting the umbilical cords with a scissors and dumping the placenta in the trash.</p><p>Her older two surviving children were not even aware the younger two were their siblings, after their mother told them they were just kids she was babysitting.</p><p>As well as the remaining murder charge, Murray is also facing two counts each of assault and battery on a child causing substantial injury, child endangerment and animal cruelty.</p><p>The father of all seven children and Murray's live-in boyfriend, 39-year-old Ray Rivera, faces separate charges of abuse.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1f510829-2f7b-52cb-8601-a4cf7bf07d69 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9ea11ec0-7d5a-5c7c-98dd-b3bc7958a0c5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/59/5by4/2019/05/22/59bd3c30fdd352d58fc896a4b43485da_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook / AP</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Skyfall' and 'World War Z' Actor's Suspected Killer is Alleged Serial Grindr Thief</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j29mamlfnby2v8Rmpp9lmKS%2Fs7vRrGSmp51ixKq4y2amp6SpYrOir8RmpK6qlJq%2Fbq%2FHmqmgnaNis7C%2BjKilnmWfm3qpsdFmq6GqlZp6pbHAnWSbmZKesrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
