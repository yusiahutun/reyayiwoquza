The latest joint patrol prompted South Korea, one of Washington’s closest allies in Asia, to <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=#

defence ministers reaffirm close bilateral ties</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for Beijing’s embassy in Washington, called the joint operations with Russia “normal and routine military exercises for the purpose of maintaining regional peace and stability” and “not aimed at third parties”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Relevant parties should stop groundless accusations and smears, stop advocating confrontation and creating ‘imaginary enemies’, abandon the Cold War mentality and camp confrontation and do more things that are conducive to world peace and stability,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Turning to another area of China-Russia cooperation, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, suggested that China had already overstepped a “red line” that US President Joe Biden set when he warned Beijing not to supply Russia with lethal weapons that could be used in its war against Ukraine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In response, Haines said that “there was a lot of focus on China not providing lethal support and what they have done is to try to avoid what is characterised as lethal support – in other words, a fully constructed gun or weapon system.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But what has happened in the meantime is they provided effectively dual-use materials such as nitrocellulose, [and] a whole series of critically important long poles in the tent for the Russia’s reconstitution of the defence industry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/24/Clean.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nitrocellulose is a raw material used in the production of propellants and explosives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Haines added that China’s shipments of such products to Russia were among “the key factors that essentially adjusted the momentum on the battlefield in Ukraine”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The intelligence chiefs also accused China and Russia of embedding malware into US infrastructure or engaging in other forms of cyber disruption.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, asked about digital sleeper cells capable of “impeding US decision-making, inducing societal panic and interfering with the deployment of US forces”, elements referred to in the 2024 Annual Threat Assessment that Haines’ office produces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What we see is both China and Russia, effectively, pre-positioning themselves in ways that would allow them to conduct those kinds of attacks, not actually yet … engaging in those attacks,” Haines said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She noted that weak passwords and other forms of lax cybersecurity controls were allowing such incidents.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0"

official</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As we’re looking at the attacks that are occurring, particularly against industrial control systems in the country, the vast, vast majority of them would have been actually prevented if it weren’t for those kinds of cybersecurity practices not being what they need to be.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Homeland Security and Energy Departments were “working very hard with [US utilities] to improve their cybersecurity practices, patch vulnerabilities and deal with these issues”, Haines said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Haines and Kruse committed to discussing more details about these attacks as well as other threats in a closed-door session with the committee that was scheduled later in the day.</p><p class=postsid
