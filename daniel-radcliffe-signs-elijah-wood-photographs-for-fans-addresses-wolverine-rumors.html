We are both short, pale, brown haired actors with blue eyes," responded Radcliffe. "But we don't actually look that alike when we're next to each other. But conceptually, we are the same."</p><p>"Do you ever get annoyed when people mistake him for you?" Mendez further continued her interrogation.</p><p>"No," responded Radcliffe swiftly. "I think it's very funny. I imagine he would get annoyed that people mistook him for me once, because I was a twelve-year-old child when he was playing Frodo, and that would have been annoying."</p><p>Co-star <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Groff</strong></a> jumped in, asking, "Do you ever tell people that you are him?"</p><p>"No, but I have signed photos of him," revealed Radcliffe, to which Mendez said she has actually witnessed that. Radcliffe then went on to share that he received a photo from a fan, who he's pretty sure is a troll, asking him to sign a picture of Elijah in Sin City.</p><p>"And you're gonna do it?" asked Groff.</p><p>"Yeah! Absolutely," said Radcliffe. "I'll sign my name. 'This is Elijah Wood.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5a46befd-2c91-4084-a669-c64d0aaff1ca data-container-ref=toofab:article:9df0db1b-6eb3-47cc-a552-b7f6ce63da7a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/70/5by4/2023/04/25/7090492ad91244069f9063c5a5b5f534_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Daniel Radcliffe Welcomes First Child with Longtime Girlfriend Erin Darke</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Radcliffe also addressed the rumors that he is getting prepared to play the Wolverine in the MCU -- a Marvel role indelibly championed by Hugh Jackman.</p><p>"Did you start the Wolverine rumor?" asked Mendez.</p><p>"No," responded Radcliffe.</p><p>"So you just got buff for no reason?" she asked in response.</p><p>"Yes! Because I'm obsessive and I wanted to -- you know. You've seen my parents they're like insane fitness people so that's just been passed on. No Wolverine."</p><p>"Flattered, but no," he concluded.</p><p>Watch the full lie detector interview above.</p><a id=gallery-link-7bacd8e7-be7a-5252-9250-e2f7f93dc1a3 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:7bacd8e7-be7a-5252-9250-e2f7f93dc1a3 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9df0db1b-6eb3-47cc-a552-b7f6ce63da7a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c0/4by3/2017/06/26/c03930e93a075e428e9760de27db250c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmanBfma6vtcSlZKuZlJi5qrLFnmSsoZejwG6xy6KhmqBdrLywsIypn6isn5y%2ForzHrGSfp6Jis6K60maYnZyimsC0sdJmrqikppq%2FqrrEZqmupZ%2BnwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
