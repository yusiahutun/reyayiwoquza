Furthermore, we never seem to be able to maintain our high self-esteem, even when we do manage to cling onto it for a little while. Like a ping-pong ball, our feeling of self-worth rises and falls in tandem with our most recent successes or failures.</p><p>Self-compassion also produces extremely solid sentiments of security and self-worth that arise just when self-esteem is at its lowest. This book does a fantastic job of explaining why it’s so crucial to treat yourself with the same kindness and care as you would a close friend.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>8. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miracle Morning By Hal Elrod</a></h4><p>Hal Elrod developed the Miracle Morning technique for personal growth in his 2012 book, “The Miracle Morning.” In summary, it tells the sleeper to rise earlier than usual in order to be able to follow a morning routine that consists of six very specific steps: exercise, reading, writing, silence, affirmations, and visualization.

In fact, Duckworth argues that people with “natural” abilities give up or quit far more quickly than those who have a strong sense of passion for what they are doing, or grit. Throughout the book, Duckworth criticizes our culture, parents, educators, and students for labeling success as “talent,” demonstrating how the greatest among us are not “talented.”Many people who are successful in their endeavors are in reality individuals who suffered with their business, ability, etc.</p><p>She demonstrates to the reader the importance of tenacity and the drive to be passionate about the task or ability being worked on. Duckworth states that “skill x effort = achievement and talent x effort = skill” in her “formula.” Reading makes one realize that, although we tend to downplay the effort required to help the achiever in the first place, we are quick to identify the achiever as having “extraordinary talent.”It is imperative that everyone read this book.
