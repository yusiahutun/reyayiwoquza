A former top surgeon at the hospital this week called for an inquiry into the mother-of-one's treatment, which he said caused her "unnecessary suffering".</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Doctors in Hong Kong were quite good to me and&nbsp;helped me a lot three years agoYIK SIU-LING, HOSTAGE-CRISIS SURVIVOR</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I am quite unhappy because the hospital did not explain to me what went wrong three years ago," said Yik, who sat in a wheelchair as she met the media for the first time since undergoing microsurgery on her lower jaw at Chang Gung Hospital on December 18.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I feel that Prince of Wales Hospital did not do well in the area of explanation," she said in response to a question from the South China Morning Post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2014/01/02/yiksiulingjan2.png>Asked about comments by Professor Andrew Burd, former head of plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery at Prince of Wales, who had said the hospital's managers had prioritised media management over medicine, Yik said she was "not clear about that".<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Actually, doctors in Hong Kong were quite good to me and helped me a lot three years ago," she said, adding that surgery was never easy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said she had spent some HK$400,000 so far in Taiwan and was not sure whether she would be able to cover the final bill when it arrived. She received an undisclosed sum from Filipino businessmen for the operation as part of a reconciliation effort between Manila and Hong Kong. The two have been at loggerheads since eight Hongkongers were killed by fired policeman Rolando Mendoza in August 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2014/01/03/6f198417a912adaa3a0c479b4cd89315.jpg>"The surgery cost is well over HK$1 million, and being a foreigner it's difficult for me to get any discount or exemptions," she said, adding that if she did not have enough to pay for follow-up operations, including plastic surgery, she might have the operations in Hong Kong.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the financial help from the Filipino businessmen, Yik said the row between Hong Kong and the Philippines had yet to be settled because Manila had not apologised or provided compensation to other survivors and the families of victims.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dr Wei Fu-chan, who led the team of surgeons that operated on Yik, said his patient would have new teeth implanted in about four months.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"In six months, she should be able to return to the condition she had hoped for, and show others her new appearance," Wei said, adding that Yik should be able to chew without difficulty in one year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Jaw operation gives hope to Manila siege survivor</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQbHBub2RtfK6tzaKjmmWSqsBuv8ienp5lo6q%2Ft7XVqKlmnpWaubR50Z6ZqKqeYq6nwMSrZKytk5iytL%2FFrqNmrJGexKK6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
