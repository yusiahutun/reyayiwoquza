The country star dropped by newlyweds Alyssa and Brett Lorenz's reception venue after a friend in the wedding party messaged him on social media.</p><p>Owen's surprise visit&nbsp;came about thanks to groomsman Parker Rew, who direct messaged Owen on Twitter.</p><p>"He's a super great dude," Rew tells <a href=#>KSFY News</a>&nbsp;of Owen. "I was just a little nervous making sure everyone was coordinated and had the timing and had everything like that right."</p><p>After Rew put his plan in motion, he learned something that made the moment extra-special:&nbsp;"I actually found out that, a couple [of] nights ago, that their first song ... dance that they were going to do was a Jake Owen song," he shares. "I didn't know that, so it sounded like it meant a little bit more to Alyssa and Brett."</p><p>The singer didn't just take a few pictures, either; according to Rew, Owen had a beer with the wedding party and chatted with them for a bit.&nbsp;After the wedding, Rew shared a few photos, and a brief video, from Owen's surprise visit on his Instagram account; readers can see them above.</p><p>"It’s tough to put into words how great Brett and Alyssa’s wedding weekend was. Having a surprise appearance by&nbsp;@jakeowenofficial&nbsp;(bad ass) was the icing on the cake for us all," Rew writes. "Congrats to the awesome couple, and thanks for letting me be a part of your special day! And Jake, thank you for being a genuine guy and helping pull off the surprise."</p><p>Owen, too, shared Brett Lorenz's tweet about his visit. "Congrats Y'all!" he <a href=#>writes</a>. "I was proud to be there."</p><p><strong>Country Stars Who Have Gotten Engaged or Married in 2019</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mbmnqww8SnZLCdlJm2r7OMrKyrqKKewKZ50qKmrrBdmLa1xYyiprCZXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
