Products with harsh chemicals may irritate the skin and should be avoided.</p><p><strong>Skin type</strong></p><p>Consider your skin type and specific needs. If you have dry or sensitive skin, opt for a body butter that offers intense hydration and soothing properties. At the same time, go for a lightweight and non-comedogenic formula if your skin is oily or acne-prone.
