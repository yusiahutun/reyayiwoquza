The company was founded with a vision and mission – to leverage leading-edge technology platforms to provide just-in-time technology services and solutions to their Fortune 1000 clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Several years ago, the founders saw the growing need for businesses to get deeper insights from the data in their business systems. In the late 90s and early years of the 21st century, businesses invested heavily in sophisticated ERP, HRIS, and CRM systems to gain 360-degree control of their operations. PKSI engaged with many such midsize and large organizations to help them successfully deploy and manage these systems.</p><p>Following this period, businesses realized that they now had access to a wealth of data on their operations and began mining their internal transactional and operational data for insights.
