Upon his return, he found his son in front of his Lake Wales mobile home. Rodda allegedly told his father, "I wouldn't go in there if I was you. I killed someone. You may need to call the police."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here are photos of 16 year old Stephen Lee Rodda, provided to PCSO from the family. Stephen is standing in the middle of his brothers and sister. His brothersâ€™ names are Matthew and Logan, and his sisterâ€™s name is Elizabeth. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4kam6olIYv</a></p>â€” Polk County Sheriff ðŸš” Grady Judd (@PolkCoSheriff) <a href=#>September 4, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@PolkCoSheriff</a><p>While the grandfather told police "it was not uncommon for his son to talk bizarre" due to his alleged history of methamphetamine use and psychotic episodes, he went inside the home and found his grandson dead in the dining room. Police believe an angle grinder -- a type of saw -- was used to kill the teen.</p><p>Rodda "fled the scene" after talking to his father, said Judd, but was apprehended about a mile away and taken into custody.</p><p>"We don't know yet why Stephen Thomas Rodda attacked and murdered his son," Judd said during the conference. "The world lost a great young man today and we've got an evil, evil man in custody and we're gonna do our best to see he spends the rest of his life in prison," he continued.</p><p>Authorities also said Rodda recently spent time in South Carolina, Washington DC, Ohio and Texas -- and even had an outstanding warrant for his arrest in South Carolina. "This guy has been nothing but a problem to society for a very long time," Judd said.</p><p>As for the young teen, Judd described him as a "stellar" young man, and said his family is heartbroken over the devastating loss.</p><p>"He was just a standup, stellar young man," he said, adding that his family is just "devastated," "heartbroken" and "don't understand" why he was murdered. "The family is just in absolute total shock," he concluded.</p><a id=gallery-link-e31f5aff-7ac3-46e8-9234-51c2133c3a5a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:e31f5aff-7ac3-46e8-9234-51c2133c3a5a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:324f4a22-6daf-40a1-ac66-38edf7533de0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/45/4by3/2023/09/05/45ee578ba06c4e0dbbdf1bf7a7eb2a61_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaW9fqMGmvMeepWaklZp6s7vDnZhmm5%2Bqv7V5wKmnnpmilruksYyspqdlnaq%2FpbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
