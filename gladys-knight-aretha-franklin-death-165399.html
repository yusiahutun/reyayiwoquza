No further details about her diagnosis, treatment or current health status have been revealed by Gladys at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>This comes just days after Gladys opened up about the music sensation’s passing at age 76. While speaking with <a href=# rel=dofollow>Us Weekly</a> at the USTA Foundation Opening Night Gala on Monday, Aug. 27 in NYC, she revealed she really misses the star, but she’s glad she’s no longer suffering.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/aretha-franklin-47.jpg><p>“We all have our days,” Gladys, 74, shared with the news outlet. “I mean, we have absolutely no control over that. The Lord tells us where we are going and tells us when we are coming. So I’m not overly upset about it, and he knows how much each one of us can bear, and he calls us home with those things in mind. That’s the way I feel about it, because he loves us like that.”</p><p>She continued, “I miss her, but I didn’t want her to suffer. I really didn’t. And, you know, people could see it. She just kept driving and driving, and she knew it was a disease that would take her out, and she just kept on doing what she does best. So Aretha, safe journey.”</p><p>Of course, Gladys isn’t the only well-known face in the music industry that misses Aretha. Shortly after her passing, <a href=# rel=dofollow>Stevie Wonder paid tribute</a> to his dear friend. “She did incredible music. She touched every genre. Every singer was influenced in some way by the way she sang and they will forever be influenced by her because of her voice, her emotion. Her sincerity is unforgettable,” the “Isn’t She Lovely” singer shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/stevie-wonder-aretha-franklin.jpg><p>He added, “She was consistently a great human being. She always, even with whatever turmoil that may have been happening in her life, even through her illness, she did not put that on anyone else. She believed she was doing God’s work and she was. She brought joy to a lot of lives.”</p><p>Aretha died on Thursday, Aug. 16 from cancer and fans have been <a href=# rel=dofollow>paying their respects</a> to the late music sensation ever since. “We have been deeply touched by the incredible outpouring of love and support we have received from close friends, supporters and fans all around the world,” her family shared at the time. “Thank you for your compassion and prayers. We have felt your love for Aretha and it brings us comfort to know that her legacy will live on.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46go5qcqah6rLrIoJ%2BtZZGnsrW0wGadq5meoLmquoydnJqsmGJ%2Bd4GScnBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
