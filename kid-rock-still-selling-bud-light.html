The controversy arose after Mulvaney shared a social media video featuring a handful of Bud Light cans sent to her by the company, as well as one custom can with her face on it, in celebration of her first full year of womanhood.</p><p>But Rock took things a step further: He shared a video on social media of himself opening fire on a couple 12-packs of Bud Light with a semi-automatic rifle, commenting, "F--k Bud Light and f--k Anheuser-Busch."</p><p>The Bud Light controversy has also generated some negative response from country stars like<a href=#> Travis Tritt</a>, who vowed to remove the brand from his tour rider. Tritt and <a href=#>Zach Bryan</a> got into a social media spat over their differing perspectives on the issue; Bryan <a href=#>tweeted his opinion</a> that "insulting transgender people is completely wrong because we live in a country where we can all just be who we want to be." The two singers subsequently reconciled in person at a festival where they were both performing.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>online menu </a>of Rock's bar, Bud Light remains available for purchase, as does Budweiser and Bud Light Lime. Busch Beer, another brand owned by Anheuser-Busch, is also still on the menu.</p><p>It's not clear whether Bud Light was removed and then re-added to the menu since Rock first voiced his opinions, or whether it's remained for sale at the Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock 'n' Roll steakhouse all along.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country Songs That Name-Check Budweiser or Bud Light</h2><p>Long before all the controversy surrounding Bud Light and the Anheuser-Busch brand sparked in spring 2023, the beer was a staple in country music lyrics. Here are some of the best songs that reference Budweiser or Bud Light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpKGUYr%2Bwr8pmqq2hnKF6tLHLpaCnn12XwqV5y6Keoaxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
