The same year the company hit U.S. News & World Report’s 200 Best Companies to Work For. It’s not surprising. Marriott employees and their families get big discounts at more than 8,600 hotels across the globe and, once they work for the company for 25 years get to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stay for free for the rest of their lives</a>. Want to get in on the fun? Read on to see how you can turn your love of travel and helping people into a fun and rewarding career with Marriott work from home jobs.</p><p>For more ways to earn with work-from-home jobs, click <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>!</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marriott work from home jobs: What do they entail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/1_08fd0c.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marriott Vacations Worldwide</a> focuses on what its name says: providing vacations. However, the company offers more than just traditional hotels. It also has vacation clubs and handles rental services for third parties. Its 31 brands include Marriott as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interval</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St. Regis Residence Club</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Westin Vacation Club</a>.</p><p>If you want to work for the company, you should love helping people plan vacations and find fun outings as a customer engagement specialist, but that’s not the only remote option available, according to the organization. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marriott employs remote </a>business operations managers, property support services specialists, accountants, information technology specialists, marketing managers and senior account executives, according to its career site.</p><p>If you’re looking to work for one of the traditional departments such as marketing, IT, or corporate sales you should have experience doing those jobs in the past. However, if you’re interested in a customer-facing job where you’ll be interacting with consumers looking to book or change their travel plans there are plenty of options for you, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A day in the life with Marriott work-from-home jobs</h2><p>Customer service agents log into a reservation system and take calls from customers during their shift, which can be any time day or night as well as on weekends. The company explains that vacations advisors (what it calls customer service people) answer questions about vacation destinations, facilities and services as well as checking availability of accommodations and dates. But that’s not all you’ll do. Another job requirement — promoting “accommodation upgrades and extra nights to drive additional revenue when available” — means you’ll also be working as a true salesperson upselling people on trips and stays.</p><p>In addition, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marriott</a> says it needs its vacation advisors to maintain confidentiality, speak using clear and professional language, and comply with quality assurance expectations and standards. People who don’t feel comfortable working directly with customers can keep an eye out for data entry positions such as a data entry clerk at the company as well. In this job you’ll take data and information from one location or source and enter it into a database</p><p>(Want to learn more about data entry jobs you can do from home?

It requires patience to listen and understand another person’s culture, upbringing and viewpoint in working together. Everyone is different and will have a different way of achieving the same goal or task,” he says.</p><p>One of the nice things about working for Marriott is that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you’re not stuck doing one position</a> if you get bored or don’t like your day-to-day schedule, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Cammack</a>, regional vice-president of human resources for Marriott Hotels of Canada explained in an interview. “There’s definitely opportunity to start a long-lasting and rewarding career,” he says.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Finding Marriott work-from-home jobs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/3_736148.jpg><p>Marriott gives job seekers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">instructions</a> about how to find remote positions on its website. “When perusing our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands of job opportunities around the world</a>, select the ‘remote’ dropdown menu and check the ‘Yes’ box. Selecting this filter will showcase all of the remote Marriott jobs — it’s that simple.”</p><p>The company also posts its WFH jobs on all the major career sites such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indeed,</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> FlexJobs</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SimplyHired,</a> and <a href=#>ZipRecruiter</a>. While pay varies, ZipRecruiter says that most Marriott work from home jobs pay an average of $18 to $20 per hour. A recent job for a remote sales administration assistant said it paid $18 to $26.91 per hour and including dental, medical and life insurance.</p><p>For all of the Marriott work from home jobs you should be prepared to prove that you can do things like type, operate computer equipment such as keyboards and a mouse, send and receive email and answer phone calls professionally. Don’t worry if you don’t have a computer yourself.
