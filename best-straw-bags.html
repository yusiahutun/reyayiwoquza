Whether you're headed to a tropical island or just running to your local farmer's market, there's no better companion than a straw bag. Often made from straw, raffia, or rattan, these bags have been around for decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">French singer Jane Birkin toted wicker baskets throughout the 1960s, turning straw bags into a summer mainstay. Stylist Victoria Barbara tells InStyle that it's all thanks to the bag's versatility. "If Birkin can don a shimmering black and gold cocktail dress at a Cannes fete <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">with a straw bag</a> on one arm and a tuxedo-clad date on another, anything goes," she explained. Although the premise of a classic straw bag has remained the same over the years, the styles available now are a little more fun and practical (think: bright colors, innovative designs, and functional details).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are a ton of straw bags out there — from bucket-shaped shoppers to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>extra-large totes</a> — so weaving through the options can be a bit tricky. To help you out, I spoke with stylists and fellow editors, as well as used my own first-hand experience to compile a list of the best straw bags. Read on for each one you'll want to take with you on all of your adventures.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-terrain-leather-handle-market-tote></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Terrain Leather Handle Market Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bbVokE4srogvoVsXeXs8oJbgTMQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthropologie-terrain-leather-handle-market-tote-8fd618a04e40459fb9fcf6cf8b27e962.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the ideal straw bag will feature a timeless look and last for years, even through standard wear and tear. Stylist Brittany Diego tells us to focus on the stitching and straps when considering a straw bag. "You want to aim for elevated materials, not just for practicality and functionality, but for an overall chic look that will stand up to the test of time," she says. And this market tote from Terrain checks all those boxes. Made from sustainable Moroccan date palm leaves and equipped with strong leather handles held together with heavy-duty white stitching, you'll never have to worry about this bag falling apart. Keep in mind: Palm leaves can get misshapen when wet, so if you need to clean the bag, we suggest spot-treating a small area and laying it out to dry in the sun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Palm, leather | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 |<strong> Dimensions</strong>: 14 H x 20 W x 5 D inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-qtkj-mini-semi-circle-rattan-straw-bag></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B092M73M1P id=product-record__image_1-0-1 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=695 data-sizes=750px alt="QTKJ Mini Semi-circle Rattan Straw Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zShITImOJXE-57bBPwaEVZe1p1k=/fit-in/1500x695/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/61GivkhGJL._AC_UY695_-c82b0036dfde4fabb0662dcda3dfa8d7.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A straw bag doesn't have to be giant — according to Diego, a small straw purse will still capture the essence of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coastal grandmother look</a> but in a more polished way. "A slouchy, oversized tote or shopper screams beach day, but a structured style like a crossbody or handbag looks much more refined," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I discovered this mini rattan purse on Amazon for less than $30. The rounded design includes a detachable crossbody strap and a rattan circle handle, giving you added versatility. And speaking of, the bag, which has an inner cotton lining that closes shut, comes in seven colors, ranging from classics like khaki and white to poppier shades like tangerine and turquoise.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Rattan, straw | <strong>Number of Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Size</strong>: 6.29 L x 9.84 W inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-anine-bing-xl-rio-tote></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-2 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1481 data-sizes=750px alt="Anine Bing XL RIO TOTE" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UaYQfL3JQ_DV5XDWwn4QBpDb-Bk=/fit-in/1500x1481/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ANINE-BING-RIOTOTE-NATURAL-A-13-3138-022_01_1700x-8bc74b181cdd45caa887eab579bf1b44.jpeg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anine Bing</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To distinguish your bag from any run-of-the-mill beach tote, Diego says that details like embellishments, unique hardware, and dark finishes are key. With its minimalistic black leather straps, modern monogram and luxe woven seagrass body, the XL Rio Tote from Anine Bing belongs with heels as much as flip flops. After taking the bag (which was kindly gifted to me by the brand) on a weekend trip to the beach, I quickly learned just how many outfits it works with — a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white button-down</a>, a cover-up, or a satin dress. And it complemented each one. The sleek black touches gave it a more elevated feel for nighttime, while the woven texture of the bag itself felt right for a boating day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One note: The bag doesn't close, but because it's so deep, you don't run the risk of your valuables falling out. And, best of all, the bag has a flat bottom that helps it stand up when you set it down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Woven seagrass, leather | <strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size</strong>: 16.1 L x 19.3 W inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designer-saint-laurent-rive-gauche-raffia-tote-bag></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-3 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1975 data-sizes=750px alt="Rive Gauche Raffia Tote Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EbHIrl-A4ysfan2ZXCUo2ic-B1I=/fit-in/1500x1975/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nm_4225082_100296_m-61b680423e4c44369cc22d3aa8ea0413.jpeg"></a> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designer items can be tricky. Sure, you want the logo to be visible, but too bold of a logo can verge on, well, tacky, too. That's why we appreciate this simple, yet sophisticated tote from Saint Laurent, which features the classic Rive Gauche logo embroidered on the front of the raffia material with Saint Laurent mentioned subtly below. The black piping around the edges frames the logo perfectly and adds an additional edgy visual element to the bag that a plain straw bag doesn't have. We love the leather handles, too, because they will certainly be more comfortable to hold for long days out. It also looks a touch more upscale than if the bag were to be completely made of raffia. We just wish the brand installed a lining inside the bag to protect the raffia from potentially getting damaged and added a lining for our valuables. But those are easy to look past, especially because it has a snap closure to keep everything shut inside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Raffia, leather | <strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size</strong>: 14.2 H x 18.9 W x 6.3 D inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-beach-mar-y-sol-amara-tote></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-4 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=2000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mar Y Sol Amara Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zWmW8Fsk5fhNWhAC6Kc4ecSpwLI=/fit-in/1500x2000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madim3019886941_1676657126429_2-0-a305be4406b74225a2e974d11d33429e.jpg"></a> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed with a roomy interior to carry all of your essentials, the Mar Y Sol bag, which comes in classic raffia, brown, and black, deserves a place on your shoulder no matter the situation — and especially to the beach. Although the bag itself is somewhat large, the strong rounded handles ensure a comfortable fit, even when it's chock full of items. It isn't lined nor does it come with a sturdy closure. But that's nothing to worry about since the bag has a flat bottom that ensures it stands up on its own. According to the brand, the sale of this bag supports artisans and their families in gaining economic independence in Madagascar, preserves traditional craft, and promotes environmental conservation. Between the bag's high-quality material and the brand's emphasis on sustainability, you'll want to pick up a tote in every color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Raffia | <strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size</strong>: 13 H x 23.5 L x 8.75 D inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bucket-aaks-tia-blush-bag></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-5 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=968 data-sizes=750px alt="AAKS Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LXcV9QDqBtNLp40cQsLFc30aKBg=/fit-in/1500x968/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aaks-bag-6e920476869748dcb9e217c4b1a43859.jpg"></a> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Masterfully crafted in Ghana, AAKS bags prove that not only is weaving an art form, but it can be a sustainable alternative for the fashion world. The brand — a Black- and women-owned business that employs over 80 percent female artisans and ensures fair pay — crafts each uniquely shaped design from raffia palm trees, which are native to the tropical areas in Africa, and distinctively decorates every one in bright colors. The result: high-quality, ethically-made bags.

Between the chic vegan leather and wicker exterior and the insulated interior, this bag completely reinvents the traditional lunchbox and makes packing your lunch actually feel fashionable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's also ideal for impromptu summer picnics. I filled the bag (which the brand kindly gifted me) with all the fixings for a charcuterie board — cheese, cured meats, fruit, and veggies — and brought it with me for an afternoon in the park. Even after the time it took me to walk to the park, find a spot, and lay down a picnic blanket, the perishables (and two cans of wine) stayed cool in the bag. To solidify its status as the perfect picnic companion, the luncher also comes with an interior pocket to hold a set of forks, knives, and spoons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Corn straw, aluminum | <strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> 14.5 x 11 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-hat-attack-the-original-straw-traveler-bag></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-7 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hat Attack The Original Straw Traveler Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h050O7LmDUsxqH3WljoUdvA8p4k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hat-attack-the-original-straw-traveler-bag-fe6bd8123a754b63b4d16503549ea496.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hat Attack</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don't have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>packable sun hat</a>?

It rolls up when you're not using it, but is big enough to fit everything you need for a beach day — from a book to a change of clothes to a big towel. After being kindly gifted the bag, I fell in love with how sturdy the raffia material felt, while still being comfortable enough when sitting on my shoulder. One thing to note: the material can unravel a bit if you rough it up (like I accidentally did), so be gentle with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Raffia straw | <strong>Number of Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size</strong>: 20 H x 14 W inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-crossbody-club-monaco-raffia-convertible-crossbody-bag></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored nocaes" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-8 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=2000 data-sizes=750px alt="Club Monaco Raffia Convertible Crossbody Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/trE25lvhG_qgJBthuiuJGjmtxI4=/fit-in/1500x2000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/s7-1452128_lifestyle-42337a6876a74262994b9acd5fd027f9.jpeg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Club Monaco</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Club Monaco Raffia Convertible Crossbody Bag is a must for someone who's always juggling a million things thanks to the hands-free (albeit stylish) experience it offers.

It comes with a sewn-in canvas lining that ensures privacy, and when you want to change it up, the leather strap can be tucked inside the purse and converted into a handbag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Raffia, leather | <strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size</strong>: 7.75 H x 7.75 W x 2.625 D inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-monogrammable-mark--graham-palm-leaf-tote></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-9 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mark &amp;amp; Graham Palm Leaf Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YtZiDrak24WSR565_VjJ4_FK-BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/totebag-07a907d7347b40eeadf93e79225a5517.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mark & Graham</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We'd be lying if we said we weren't instantly attracted to monograms — who doesn't love their name on stuff? — and that's why we love Mark and Graham, which is known for its personalization capabilities. Choose between 19 different letter styles from traditional monograms to minimalist fonts and 26 different colors for your monogram. It will be stitched into the bag, too, so you'll never have to worry about it wearing away. Yes, the embroidered letters cost nearly $13 more, but for the novelty of it and the fact that you'll definitely have this bag for years on end, we think it's worth it. The bag also comes fully lined with an interior pocket and sturdy leather handles, so it's as functional as it is attractive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Palm leaf, leather | <strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size</strong>: 20 W x 8.5 D x 14 H inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-backpack-lspace-summer-days-backpack></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B07XC13D23 id=product-record__image_1-0-10 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L*Space Summer Days Backpack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pJ_opQYm9tLdcjPE3nhdT8ZqVd8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lspace-summer-days-backpack-178c6712f28e4deea605d53b461a15e6.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>While it's intended to be worn as a backpack, it features top handles, too, for versatility.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the ultimate schleppers among us, we understand how much more functional a backpack can be compared to a heavy tote. But that doesn't mean you should miss out on the trend. Try this backpack from L*Space, which has a straw body with adjustable canvas shoulder straps. The linen-like lining pulls closed with a drawstring to keep everything enclosed inside, and the interior pocket features a zipper, too, to ensure your keys will never accidentally go missing again. Just be aware that the straps can only be adjusted by a buckle, which can sometimes be challenging to maneuver, especially in a pinch. We recommend finding your preferred fit before storing your things inside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Straw, canvas, polyester | <strong>Number of Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size</strong>: 16 W x 13.5 H x 6.5 D inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material<strong></strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for a straw bag, remember that the material matters — especially if you want your bag to last. To pick the right material, Diego suggests aiming for strong, durable options like raffia and rattan, both of which are made from types of palm leaves. With that said, it's important to know what your bag is made of in order to find out how to properly clean it and care for it. For example, bags made with raffia straw should be spot cleaned with a damp cloth and then left to dry in the sun to prevent mold growth.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style<strong></strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To pick the style best for you, stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Makeda Saggau-Sackey</a> tells us to consider the function of the bag first. "Choose a large tote if you tend to carry a lot of things in your bag," she says. "If you want something more elegant, look for bags with luxe elements. Colorful straw bags in fun shapes make accessorizing fun." She notes that while minimalism is having a moment, an oversized bag definitely makes a statement — especially if you add pops of color, a fun fringe, and embellishments into the mix.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Details</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Diego, if you're seeking a bag to take you beyond beach days, look for bags with metal hardware and quality closures, like twist-locks or magnetic snaps, and dark finishes. She says that clues like the stitching of the lining can signify that it's high quality. If the seams look strong and wound tightly, chances are the bag will be more durable than one with loose stitching.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you style a straw bag?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Diego, you can style a straw bag to elevate an outfit by keeping three things top of mind: size, structure, and color. "It's all about how the overall outfit is put together; for example, a black straw crossbody with a blazer and tailored shorts is a much different feel than a brown straw tote with a dress," she says. "But, some styles can be worn with anything from a classic, flowy summer dress to a traditionally professional piece like a blazer and trousers."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn</a> is a former commerce writer for InStyle who currently writes for Byrdie.
