It even drew the biggest crowd, with over 100,000 people watching the iconic singer -- but it appears not everyone was happy with her performance.</p><p>“Oh, Dolly is miming. How disappointing,” Sky News anchor Kay Burley said via <a href=#>Twitter</a>. It was this comment that began huge debate. Was she or wasn't she singing? Even celebrities chimed in on what they thought. But now, Parton herself has come forward.</p><p>“My boobs are fake, my hair’s fake but what is real is my voice and my heart,” she tells the Sun (quote via the&nbsp;<a href=#>Guardian</a>). And her reps say she's telling the truth.</p><p>“It’s ridiculous to suggest Dolly was miming. She’s been performing for more than 60 years -- she doesn’t need to,” one representative for the legend explains. “This should not overshadow what was truly a great gig and accomplished performance. Dolly adored every single moment.”</p><p>“No, she sings live,” another Parton rep tells <a href=#>MSN.com</a>. “Some people don’t know an amazing singer when they hear one.”</p><p>Parton seemed to enjoy herself at Glastonbury, and she even had a special guest -- <a href=#>Richie Sambora</a> joined her on stage for a <a href=#>duet</a>. In addition, she was also awarded a plaque for her success in music, so we'd say the festival was a win for the 68-year-old star, despite naysayers.</p><p><strong>Startling Facts About Women and Country Music</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaecocZuvMCrq6imXaG2sXnSsqWcoJmjtG6%2B1Kamq6tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
