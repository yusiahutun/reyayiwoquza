Find Out</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>At Friday Night SmackDown after WrestleMania 40, the WWE Universe witnessed a significant twist. Solo Sikoa turned his back on Roman Reigns and announced that he would bring change to The Bloodline following Roman Reigns's loss against Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40.</p><p>The former Enforcer of The Bloodline has no intention of serving Roman Reigns, and today, we witnessed the entry of another member into The Bloodline: newly signed WWE superstar Tama Tonga. Tama Tonga attacked Jimmy Uso and joined forces with Solo Sikoa.</p><p>Fans are now asking how Tama Tonga is related to Roman Reigns, The Rock, and the Samoan heritage in WWE. Alipate Aloisio Leone, aka Tama Tonga, is a Tongan professional wrestler. He was adopted by his maternal aunt and her husband, the famous professional wrestler Haku.</p><p>Tama Tonga is Haku's stepson and is related to the Anoa'i family. Although Haku is not a blood relative of the Anoa'i family, he is from the same island as Peter Maivia, the grandfather of The Rock and the granduncle of Roman Reigns.</p><p>The answer is that Tama Tonga is not related to Roman Reigns and&nbsp;The Rock. They do not share the same blood, but they belong to the same island and have good family relationships. Pacific Islanders usually consider their fellow islanders as relatives. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><br><h2 id=661e05c7825ba>Why does the Anoa'i family Consider Tama Tonga Family?&nbsp;</h2><p>Part of the Anoa'i family and a professional wrestler, Lance Anoa'i explained the island theory and how Tama Tonga is part of a great wrestling family: "Not by blood. We consider him family every time I see Haku; he's my uncle, a lot of respect for him. It's just more like the island culture. We're all from the South Pacific, so the islanders stick together, man. It's just one breed."</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>The debut of Tama Tonga and Solo Sikoa's heel turn on The Tribal Chief Roman Reigns has unveiled the next chapter in The Bloodline Saga.
